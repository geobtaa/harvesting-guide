## About

This site provides guidance on harvesting metadata for the [BTAA Geoportal](https://geo.btaa.org).

The BTAA Geoportal holds metadata records that point to geospatial data, maps, aerial imagery, web services, and websites hosted online by external organizations. The most common way of obtaining this metadata is to programmatically harvest it from an organization's website. These websites may be in the form of a data portal, a static page, or custom platform. Due to the many variations in how the different websites are structured, we have several workflows for obtaining the metadata.

## Structure

This Harvesting Guide is structured in four sections as described by the [DiÃ¡taxis framework:](https://diataxis.fr)

**1. Tutorials**: The Tutorial section contains short, easy to complete exercises to help someone get the basics of running and writing scripts to harvest metadata.

> *"Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. Tutorials are learning-oriented."* [https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/)

**2. Recipes**: The recipes are step by step workflows for harvesting metadata from specific websites or groups of portals using the same technology. They may involve multiple steps and require manual troubleshooting at times. These guides will need regular maintenance and updates as the source websites may upgrade, change, or disappear.

> *"How-to guides (i.e. "recipes") are directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. How-to guides are goal-oriented."* [https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/](https://diataxis.fr/how-to-guides/)

**3. Reference**: The Reference section contains definitions and helpful links about the concepts, tools, and metadata standards involved in harvesting.

> *"Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is information-oriented."* [https://diataxis.fr/reference/](https://diataxis.fr/reference/)

**4. Explanation**: This section includes documentation about different aspects of metadata harvesting that affects the BTAA-GIN workflows. It discusses challenges with certain platforms, why we made certain decisions, and background information on some of the technology. 

> *"Explanation is discussion that clarifies and illuminates a particular topic. Explanation is understanding-oriented."* [https://diataxis.fr/explanation/](https://diataxis.fr/explanation/)
