# Purpose

## What is the purpose of this work?

!!! abstract "summary"

	The BTAA Geoportal is a catalog that makes it easier to find geospatial resources. 

Geospatial data and tools are increasingly important in academic research and education. With the growing number of GIS datasets and digitized historical maps available, it can be challenging to locate the right resources since they are scattered across various platforms and not always tagged with the necessary metadata for easy discovery. To address this issue, the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Data Project launched in 2015 to connect scholars with geospatial resources.

One of the primary outputs of the project is the BTAA Geoportal, a comprehensive index of tens of thousands of geospatial resources from hundreds of sources. The Geoportal enables users to search by map, keyword, and category, providing access to scanned maps, digital GIS data, aerial imagery, and interactive mapping applications. All of the resources available through the Geoportal are free and open, and the scanned maps cover countries around the world. Most of the data in the catalog is sourced from local governments, such as states, counties, and cities.

The Geoportal is a useful tool because finding local geospatial data through a simple Google search can be difficult due to the lack of visibility of these datasets. The problem is that users need to know which agency is responsible for creating and distributing the data they are looking for and visit that agency's website to access the datasets. For instance, if you are researching a particular neighborhood in a city and need data on the roads, parks, parcels, and city council ward boundaries, you might need to check different state agencies, the city or the county website. But with the Geoportal, you can easily search by **What**, **Where**, and **When** without worrying about the **Who** or **Why**.

Overall, the BTAA Geoportal provides an easy and comprehensive way for scholars to find and access geospatial resources from various sources, enabling them to focus on their research rather than the time-consuming task of finding the right data.


## The challenge of ephemeral data

!!! abstract "summary"

	Many of the resources in the BTAA Geoportal are from sites that continually update their datasets. As a result, we need to regularly re-harvest the metadata. 

Government agencies now issue most geospatial information as digital data instead of as physical maps. However, many academic libraries have not yet expanded their collection scopes to include publicly available digital data, and are therefore no longer systematically capturing and storing the changing geospatial landscape for future researchers. 

The BTAA Geoportal partially fills a gap in the geospatial data ecosystem by cataloging **metadata** records for current publicly available state, county, and municipal geospatial resources. The value of this data is high, as researchers routinely use it to form the base layers for web maps or geographic analysis. However, the the mandates and policies for providing this data varies considerably from state to state and from county to county. The lack of consistent policies at this level of government means that this data can be considered ephemeral, as providers regularly migrate, update, delete, and re-publish data without saving previous versions and without notification to the public.

The lack of standard policies at this level of government means that this data can be considered ephemeral. It may be updated, removed, or replaced without notification to the public. The rate at which datasets change or disappear is variable, but is often high.

This continual turnover creates a difficult environment for researchers to properly source data and replicate results. It also requires a great deal of dedicated labor to maintain the correct access links in the geoportal. As the geoportalâ€™s collection grows, the labor required to maintain it grows as well.
