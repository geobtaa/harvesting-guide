\f0\fs24 \cf0 # -- DIATAXIS Framework for Inspiration for Harvesting Guide --\
\
## Di\'e1taxis identifies four modes of documentation - tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference and explanation. It derives its structure from the relationship between them.\
\
- In Di\'e1taxis, each of these modes (or types) answers to a different user need, fulfils a different purpose and requires a different approach to its creation.\
\
- Technical documentation should be structured explicitly around these four types, and should keep them all separate and distinct from each other.\
\
- In other words, what we call documentation is fundamentally not one thing, but four. Understanding the implications of this, and how those four different things work, can help improve most documentation.\
\
# 1. Tutorials \
\
# *Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. Tutorials are learning-oriented.*\
\
### A tutorial must help a beginner achieve basic competence with a product, so that they can go on to use the product for their own purposes.\
\
### A tutorial also needs to show the learner that they can be successful with the product - by having them do something both meaningful and attainable.\
\
# 2. 'Recipes' How-To-Guides\
\
# *How-to-guides are directions that take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem. How-to guides are goal-oriented.*\
\
### How-to guides matter not just because users need to be able to accomplish things: the list of how-to guides in your documentation helps frame the picture of what your product can actually do. A rich list of how-to guides is an encouraging suggestion of a product\'92s capabilities.\
\
### If they\'92re well-written and address the right subjects, you\'92re likely to find that how-to guides are the most-read sections of your documentation.\
\
### Consider a recipe, an excellent model for a how-to guide. It\'92s not the responsibility of a recipe to teach you how to make something.  Even following a recipe requires at least basic competence. Someone who has never cooked before should not be expected to follow a recipe with success, so a recipe is not a substitute for a cooking lesson.\
\
# 3. 'Technical' Reference\
\
# *Reference guides are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. Reference material is information-oriented.*\
\
### The only purpose of a reference guide is to describe, as succinctly as possible, and in an orderly way. Whereas the content of tutorials and how-to guides are led by needs of the user, reference material is led by the product it describes.\
\
### Reference material should be austere and to the point. One hardly reads reference material; one consults it. There should be no doubt or ambiguity in reference; it should be wholly authoritative.\
\
### Although reference should not attempt to show how to perform tasks, it can and often needs to include a description of how something works or the correct way to use it.\
\
# 4. Explanation \
\
# *Explanation is discussion that clarifies and illuminates a particular topic. Explanation is understanding-oriented.*\
\
### Explanation clarifies, deepens and broadens the reader\'92s understanding of a subject. It\'92s not concerned with what the user might be doing, like tutorials and how-to guides. Explanation joins things together. It\'92s documentation that it makes sense to read while away from the product itself.\
\
### In the case of explanation, it\'92s useful to have a real or imagined why question to serve as a prompt. Otherwise, you simply have to draw some lines that mark out a reasonable area and be satisfied with that.\
