# Why CSVs?

CSV (Comma Separated Values) files are used widely in the world of harvesting and scraping data from the web, including data science because they are simple, lightweight, and widely supported. CSV files are a type of file format used to store tabular data in plain text format, where each row of data is separated by a line break, and each column of data is separated by a delimiter.

CSV files are easy to read and write, can be opened with a simple text editor, and can be processed using many programming languages, including Python. Python has built-in libraries, such as csv, that allow you to read and write CSV files easily.
