* These recipes are all in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.
* They encompass the sites that we harvest the most frequently.
* These guides will need regular maintenance and updates as the source websites may upgrade, change, or disappear.

!!! warning
	These recipes are not guaranteed to work! Since they rely on external websites, the scripts are necessarily works-in-progress. They need to be regularly updated and reconfigured in response to changes at the source website, python updates, and adjustments to our metadata schema.


## Common APIs

These scripts access existing, documented API access points to harvest metadata.
