,"AgroEcoregions, Minnesota","Minnesota has 39 agroecoregions. Each agroecoregion is associated with a specific combination of soil types, landscape and climatic features, and landuse. Agroecoregions are units having relatively homogeneous climate, soil and landscapes, and land use/land cover. Agroecoregions can be associated with a specific set of soil and water resource concerns, and with a specific set of management practices to minimize the impact of land use activities on soil and water resource quality.

,Minnesota Agricultural Water Quality Certification Program (MAWQCP) Pilot and Expanded Areas,"The Minnesota Agricultural Water Quality Certification Program (MAWQCP) is a voluntary opportunity for farmers and agricultural landowners to take the lead in implementing conservation practices that protect our water. Those who implement and maintain approved farm management practices will be certified and in turn obtain regulatory certainty for a period of ten years. The program is the product of a state-federal partnership that includes the Minnesota Department of Agriculture, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Minnesota Agricultural Water Quality Certification Program was initially piloted in four distinct regions of the state; these areas represented a diversity of Minnesota's agricultural landscapes and cropping systems, differences in water resource concerns and also leverage the strength of existing local partnerships. The pilot areas include: Elm Creek in Cottonwood, Faribault, Jackson, Martin and Watonwan counties, the Middle Sauk River in Stearns County, Whiskey Creek in Otter Tail and Wilkin counties, and the Whitewater River in Olmsted, Wabasha and Winona counties. In June and July 2015 the program was expanded first to several counties and then to the entire state of Minnesota. The MAWQCP was expanded across the state in coordination with Soil and Water Conservation Districts and our other partners. Interested producers can find their nearest certification provider by contacting MDA at 651-201-6489 or MDA.MAWQCP@state.mn.us.

,"High Resolution Orthoimage (DOQ), Border Region of NW Minnesota, NE North Dakota, and Southern Manitoba, Canada, 2009","This dataset consists of 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot), natural color orthoimages covering the Border Region of NW Minnesota, NE North Dakota, and Southern Manitoba, Canada in 2009.USGS originally delivered to MnGeo a collection of TIF files in either UTM Zone 14 (western portion) or Zone 15 (eastern portion) projections. MnGeo projected all tiles into UTM Zone 15 and loaded into the Minnesota Geospatial Image Service as a single layer.An orthoimage (DOQ) is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot). The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 6 meter horizontal RMSE (root mean square error) for locations within the United States. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 1500-meter by 1500-meter block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum, spheroid GRS80. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG), taking the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage.MnGeo metadata is based on metadata provided by 3001, Inc., for the Zone 15 and Zone 14 tile datasets.

One Watershed, One Plan is rooted in this history and in work initiated in 2011 by the Local Government Water Roundtable (Association of Minnesota Counties, Minnesota Association of Watershed Districts, and Minnesota Association of Soil and Water Conservation Districts). Roundtable members determined that it is in the public interest to manage groundwater and surface water resources from the perspective of watersheds to achieve protection, preservation, enhancement, and restoration of the state's valuable water resources. Supporting this determination, the Roundtable recommended that the local governments charged with water management should organize and develop focused implementation plans on a watershed scale. The recommendation was followed by the One Watershed, One Plan legislation (Minnesota Statutes §103B.101 Subd. 14,)that permits the Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) to adopt methods to allow comprehensive plans, local water management plans, or watershed management plans to serve as substitutes for one another; or to be replaced with one comprehensive watershed management plan. The legislation also required BWSR to establish a suggested watershed boundary framework for these plans. This Framework consists of three parts: the suggested boundary map; procedures for establishing boundaries, requesting variances on boundaries, and appealing boundaries; and the criteria used to establish and consider requested variances from the suggested boundary map.",English,MN Board of Water and Soil Resources,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Boundaries,one plan|one watershed,2015-04-16T17:14:20.657120,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-1w1p-planning-areas,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_bwsr/bdry_1w1p_planning_areas/shp_bdry_1w1p_planning_areas.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_bwsr/bdry_1w1p_planning_areas/metadata/metadata.html,,41d293c8-c014-45f5-8479-564b8667f8d3,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Natural Area Registry,"Natural Area Registry (NAR) Sites layer version supporting SNA Work Planning application.natural_area-registry-sites_boundaries: A polygon database delineated on and digitized from 1:24,000 U.S.G.S. quad maps of Minnesota Natural Area Registry (NARs). (The following text is partially excerpted from: Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) Program Administrative Handbook, Draft EWR Divisional Directive 103, Natural Area Registry, MN DNR, Scientific and Natural Areas Program.)A Natural Area Registry (NAR) Site is a qualifying natural area managed by a government entity (a unit of the federal, state, or local government, (identified as ""Landowner"", or another Division within DNR, identified as ""Primary Administrator"") that is covered by a NAR Agreement by which the site becomes part of the Natural Area Registry. Sites in this program are managed by various public agencies with management recommendations provided by the Scientific and Natural Areas program and Regional Ecologist. NARs are established through the use of Natural Area Registry (NAR) Agreements which are non-binding written agreements between the Division of Ecological and Water Resources (EWR) and another governmental entity. The NAR Agreement identifies the site, explains its significance, describes a proposed management direction, and states that before any management contrary to that direction may occur, the parties who signed the agreement will discuss that proposed management activity. Note: formerly a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" (MOU) was the vehicle used as the NAR agreement and in many documents, preceding development of this Directive, these terms were used interchangeably.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Natural Areas Registry is intended to recognize tracts of public land that contain natural features of statewide ecological significance and possess exceptional scientific or educational value. NARs recognize the agencies and individuals that manage these lands to protect and perpetuate the features of interest. Minnesota Statute 86A.05, Subd. 5 states that the Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas Program was ""established to protect and perpetuate in an undisturbed natural state those natural features which possess exceptional scientific or educational value."" This Registry acknowledges that many of Minnesota's finest natural areas occur on other public lands that are not designated as SNAs. Through adoption of ecologically-based management principles and voluntary coordination between the land manager and the SNA Program, Registry sites protect a broader cross section of the state's natural diversity. Tracts of public land that contain viable examples of natural features of statewide ecological significance may be identified as NAR candidate sites. Qualifying sites are selected based upon Landowner/Primary Administrator interest and on the site's ecological quality. Priority is given to sites that are within MCBS-mapped outstanding and high biodiversity significance sites, are predominantly MCBS-mapped native plant communities, and contain habitat for rare species and Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), or geological features of statewide significance. Sites nominated for potential NAR registration are reviewed using information compiled in an Ecological Evaluation (EE) or brief written summary of natural features, to determine if the site qualifies for NAR and if protection through NAR is acceptable to all parties. The Natural Areas Registry was established in the early 1980s within the DNR Section of Wildlife's Natural Heritage Program, in order to recognize public lands which contain natural features of special interest and to facilitate their protection and perpetuation. The Registry was modeled after The Nature Conservancy's Private Lands Register, which is no longer in existence. A number of other states (and international governmental entities) have a Natural Area Registry or Natural Area Register, which may supplement or be in lieu of a system of designated Natural Areas. In 1986, the administration of the Registry, with 26 NAR sites, was transferred from the Natural Heritage Program to the SNA Program. Both programs were within the DNR Section of Wildlife at the time. The first NAR site established was the Soudan Iron Formation at Tower Soudan State Park, February 1982. From the inception of the Natural Area Registry in 1982 through April 2014, there are 41 sites in the Registry. Note: through 2011 the NAR has been referred to as both Natural Area Register and Natural Area Registry, with adoption of this directive, the name Natural Area Registry will consistency be used in all future NAR Agreements, and if/when updated, previous agreements will be changed to use this naming convention.This Representation SNA boundaries is based on the NAR_BASE_DATA feature class in the DNR's core GIS Library. It includes only DEDICATED features, which are dissolved on the following attributes: SITENAME, SITE_ID, BREMCODE. The coverage should be reasonably accurate although the boundaries probably will not line up with other public land survey information. Some of the boundaries for NAR sites have been created by DNR and other partner staff, and are often sub units within a larger unit. Since the NAR boundaries have no legal standing, the accuracy of boundaries vary from site to site, but are typically reasonable approximations of the NAR site boundary.",English,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) - Division of Ecological and Water Resources, Scientific & Natural Areas (SNA) Program",State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Boundaries,managed areas|rare plant communities|scientific and natural areas|sna,2014-07-29T15:04:46.057707,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-natural-area-registry,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/shp_bdry_natural_area_registry.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_natural_area_registry/preview/preview.jpg,ecce73a6-1819-4537-90fd-f08c91bb7204,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Scientific and Natural Area Units,"This dataset includes the main MNDNR Scientific and Natural Areas (SNA) feature class, along with ancillary feature classes such as annotation and parking lots. These feature classes support MNNR's SNA Work Planning application.scientific_and_natural_area_boundaries: A polygon feature class delineated on and digitized from 1:24,000 U.S.G.S. quad maps of Minnesota Scientific and Natural Areas (SNAs).Scientific and natural areas are established to protect and perpetuate in an undisturbed natural state those lands and waters embracing natural features of exceptional scientific and educational value. The SNA Program's goal is to ensure that no single rare feature is lost from any region of the state. This requires protection and management of each feature in sufficient quantity and distribution across the landscape. The Programs' Long Range Plan is to protect at least five locations of plant communities known to occur in each landscape region, and three locations per region of each rare species, plant or animal, and geologic feature. It is estimated that 500 natural areas are needed throughout the state to adequately protect significant features. Because over 40 percent of these rare features occur in prairies, 200 SNAs would be in the prairie area of the state. Of the remainder, approximately 135 are estimated to be needed in the deciduous and 165 in coniferous forest landscape communities in the next 100 years. Protection of multiple sites in each landscape region is a vital means of capturing the genetic diversity and preventing the loss of important species, communities, and features. This strategy observes the wisdom of not putting all our eggs in one basket. In addition to SNA, Itasca and Crow Wing Counties have established county natural areas. Itasca County's natural areas were established in 1966. Sites are set aside as SNAs because of their natural attributes and rare resources, which warrant protection for their inherent values and as places for scientific and educational use. Protection guards against developments such as trails, campgrounds, picnic sites, logging, mineral exploration and development, cultivation, and other uses of land, public or private, that interfere with the preservation of its natural features",English,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR),State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Boundaries,managed areas|rare plant communities|scientific and natural areas|sna,2014-06-25T21:29:03.152409,,,,Minnesota,"-96.595,43.455,-89.923,48.995",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-scientific-and-nat-areas,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_scientific_and_nat_areas/shp_bdry_scientific_and_nat_areas.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_scientific_and_nat_areas/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_scientific_and_nat_areas/preview/preview.jpg,228637da-28e2-47c8-b6ff-cc198da31565,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Watershed Management Districts and Organizations,"This data set depicts watershed district and watershed management organization boundaries throughout the state of Minnesota. Watershed districts are local units of government that work to solve and prevent water-related problems. The boundaries of the districts closely follow those of a natural watershed (an area in which all water drains to one point). Minnesota has 46 watershed districts, most of which are named after the primary lake or river within the watershed. Minnesota's watershed districts do not cover the entire state. They are created through a local petition process. Minnesota Statute Chapter 103D governs the formation and operation of watershed districts. In 1982, the Minnesota Legislature approved the Metropolitan Area Surface Water Management Act (Minnesota Statutes 103B.201 to 255), which requires local units of government in the seven-county Metro Area to prepare and implement comprehensive surface water management plans through membership in a watershed management organization (WMO).A watershed management organization (WMO) is defined as a watershed district wholly within the seven-county, Twin Cities Metropolitan Area or a joint powers entity established wholly or partly in the metropolitan area by special law or agreement to perform some or all of the functions of a watershed district.

,"ZIP Code Tabulation Areas, 5-digit (ZCTA5), Minnesota, 2010","ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data for each decennial census. The Census Bureau uses tabulation blocks as the basis for defining each ZCTA. Tabulation blocks are assigned to a ZCTA based on the most frequently occurring ZIP Code for the addresses contained within that block. The most frequently occurring ZIP Code also becomes the five-digit numeric code of the ZCTA.

These groups of native species form recognizable units, such as an oak forest, a prairie, or a marsh, that tend to repeat across the landscape and over time.Native plant communities are generally classified and described by considering vegetation, hydrology, land forms, soils, and natural disturbance regimes. The native plant community types and subtypes in this data layer are classified primarily by vegetation and major habitat features.Areas that are not mapped as native plant community polygons primarily represent: 1) land where modern human activities such as farming, overgrazing, wetland drainage, recent logging and residential and commercial development have destroyed or greatly altered the natural vegetation; and 2) native plant community polygons that were below minimal size criteria.Note: some areas that are not mapped are important for conservation.

,Mississippi River Corridor Critical Area (MRCCA) Significant Existing Vegetative Stands,"As part of the MRCCA program's requirements, local units of government are required to map significant existing vegetative stands for planning purposes. These significant plant communities can be identified by referencing a community's MRCCA plan, which was created using the layer file downloadable below. This data can also be obtained by referencing the MRCCA_sig attribute field in the shapefile. The vegetation data describing significant existing vegetative stands in the MRCCA has been derived from the National Park Service (NPS) Vegetation Inventory Program (VIP), which mapped existing vegetation in all national park units, including the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MNRRA). The boundaries of the Minnesota-designated MRCCA are identical to the boundaries of the federally designated Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MNRRA). The NPS has made this data available for planning purposes in the MRCCA. The ""MRCCA Significant Existing Vegetative Stands"" layer (.lyr) file, which was created by the DNR, was derived from the NPS' inventory to only depict existing vegetation stands considered ""significant."" The plant communities identified in this layer file were identified as significant because they are largely intact and connected and contain a sufficient representation of the original native plant community to be identifiable as a distinct class. Much of this vegetation includes an overstory or tree canopy that contributes to the scenic value of the MRCCA. This vegetation provides high ecological value in addition to the water quality and scenic values of ""natural vegetation."" Ecologically, this vegetation provides species diversity, habitat for endangered and threatened plants (supporting 19 state-listed rare plant species and 15 state-listed rare animal species in the MRCCA), and a continuous corridor where plants and animals can naturally spread and disperse. This latter characteristic is especially important as habitat becomes more fragmented, climate change accelerates, and invasive species increase. In addition, these vegetation areas serve as living remnants of the original native communities that existed in the corridor, even though they do not meet the size and quality criteria to be classified as a Native Plant Community by the MBS.The downloadable dataset contains files for the entire NPS VIP evaluation of the MNRRA, beyond just those categorized as ""significant"" for the purposes of the MRCCA. This evaluation was part of an effort to classify, describe, and map existing vegetation of national park units for the NPS Natural Resource Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) Program. The NPS VIP is managed by the NPS Inventory and Monitoring Division and provides baseline vegetation information to the NPS Natural Resource I&M Program. The USGS Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center, NatureServe, and NPS Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MISS) have completed vegetation classification and mapping of MISS for the NPS VIP. Mappers, ecologists, and botanists collaborated to identify and describe vegetation types within the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC) and to determine how best to map them by using aerial imagery. Features were interpreted from viewing color-infrared digital aerial imagery dated September and October 2012 (during peak leaf-phenology change of trees) via digital onscreen three-dimensional stereoscopic workflow systems in geographic information systems (GIS). The interpreted data were digitally and spatially referenced, thus making the spatial database layers usable in GIS. Polygon units were mapped to either a 0.5 ha or 0.25 ha minimum mapping unit, depending on vegetation type.

The MRCCA is a land corridor along the Mississippi River in the seven-county metro area in which special land use regulations guide development activity. The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances. Rules regulating the MRCCA were published on December 27, 2016 and became effective January 4, 2017. The rules establish definitions and standards relating to bluffs and bluff impact zones (BIZs) in the MRCCA. In these rules, bluffs are identified as natural topographic features having:- A slope that rises at least 25 feet and the grade of the slope averages 18 percent or greater measured over a horizontal distance of 25 feet, where:----- The slope begins above the ordinary high water level, from the toe of the slope to the top of the slope; or----- Where the slope begins below the ordinary high water level, from the ordinary high water level to the top of the slope; or- A natural escarpment or cliff with a slope that rises at least ten feet above the ordinary high water level or toe of the slope, whichever is applicable, to the top of the slope, with a slope of 75 degrees or greater.The BIZ is defined as the bluff and land within 20 feet of the bluff.

,"Buffer Protection Map, Minnesota","These data represent public waters and public ditches that require permanent vegetation buffers or alternative riparian water quality practices. The buffer map data comprise two geographical feature classes: one linear feature class for watercourses and one polygonal feature class for lakes, reservoirs and wetlands. The attribute for the buffer width requirement is derived from three different classification attributes: (1) the Minnesota DNR's Public Waters Inventory classification, (2) the DNR assigned shoreland classification, and (3) public open drainage system data (also referred to as open ditches) established under Minnesota Statute (M.S.) 103E and provided by local drainage authorities. The DNR Commissioner has validated the authenticity of this map for purposes described in M.S. 103F.48. Public waters are all lakes, wetlands and watercourses that meet the criteria set forth in M.S. 103G.005, subd. 15 and are designated on public waters inventory maps. Public water wetlands without DNR shoreland classifications are excluded from the buffer map. The DNR coordinated with counties and watershed districts to identify public ditches that require a buffer.The buffer protection map helps landowners identify buffer protection requirements, under Minnesota's Buffer Law. Public ditches require a 16.5-foot buffer and public waters require a 50-foot average buffer; public ditches that are also public watercourses require a 16.5-foot buffer unless the DNR assigned a specific shoreland classification, in which case a 50-foot average buffer is required. Local ordinances may require wider buffers. This map displays minimum standards and is not intended to affect existing local controls that are more restrictive than these requirements. Furthermore, the buffer map does not depict ""other waters"" to be addressed by local water plans and does not identify locations where local Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) have selected an alternate water quality practice.

Metro Conservation Corridors, green infrastructure analysis in counties just north of the metro area, and green infrastructure analysis in counties in the southeast part of the state.This is an interpretation of both functional and conceptual natural habitat corridors that link high quality natural communities both within and between counties of Central Minnesota. Base maps that were referenced include the Minnesota County Biological Survey, the Regionally Significant Ecological Areas, DNR Public Recreation Information Map, 2003 Farm Service Agency color aerial photos, and various lakes and rivers data sets. Base maps were overlain and polygons developed in areas where there was a high density of mapped features: MCBS plant communities, RSEA, WMA. The resulting polygons were assessed for the connectivity. Stream connections were primarily used to create either conceptual and / or functional corridors connecting these polygons. Due to local geology, this may lead to connectivity along only one axis. Where necessary to create connectivity along the opposing axis, additional connections were created using both RSEA and FSA aerial photos along areas not served by surface water connections. Finally, the polygons were visually checked against the FSA aerial photos to adjust for areas that have been developed and to adjust for roadways and other limitations.The southeast analysis also used steep slope areas, riparian areas, and geological edges.",English,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR),State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Environment,ecological corridors,2015-03-18T08:01:52.976491,,,,Minnesota,"-95.061,43.483,-91.127,46.369",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-green-infrastructure,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_green_infrastructure/shp_env_green_infrastructure.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_green_infrastructure/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_green_infrastructure/metadata/preview.jpg,bc5d23ce-cf06-48e7-81cb-ce4206f379d1,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,DNR Hydrography - Lakes with Fish-based IBI Scores (Most Recent IBI Survey),"This layer shows the Fish IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) Scores for MN lakes as calculated by DNR Fisheries. Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating higher biotic integrity. Attributes correspond to the most recent IBI survey for each lake.An IBI (Index of Biotic Integrity) is a biologically-based, multi-metric method for measuring the integrity of aquatic systems. Minnesota DNR Fisheries Research has developed a fish-based lake IBI that incorporates fish data collected by various methods (trap nets, gill nets, shoreline seines, and backpack electrofishing units) into 8-15 metrics in three categories: species richness, community assemblage, and trophic composition (see Section 5: Attributes). Each metric represents an aspect of the biological assemblage structure, function, or other measurable characteristic that changes in some predictable way with increased human-induced stress. Fish IBI scores respond to differences in land use patterns, trophic state, and aquatic vegetation.Validation studies indicate that the fish-based lake IBI scores function as a measure of fish community response to human disturbance across a gradient of lakes. Continuing work by DNR Fisheries will expand the application of this IBI to more lake types and will validate this tool as a viable method for assessing lake impairment as part of Minnesota's 303(d) Impaired Waters assessments. These scores should be considered as 'preliminary' and are subject to change as the IBI tools are further developed and refined. This dataset only includes lakes over 100 acres and within lake classes 20-43, with few exceptions for lakes very close to 100 acres. Additional scores will be added to this dataset annually.

,Lake Plant Eutrophication IBI,"Eutrophication may have detrimental effects on a lake, including reductions in the quantity and diversity of aquatic plants, fish and wildlife. The ability to assess the biological condition of a lake plant community is a valuable tool in the conservation of Minnesota's lakes. With this objective in mind, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed a lake plant index of biological integrity (IBI) to measure the response of a lake plant community to eutrophication. This Lake Plant Eutrophication IBI is used by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) to determine if a lake is meeting the federal Clean Water Act standards with regard to aquatic life use. The MPCA will use this IBI to identify lakes that are impaired (i.e., not supporting aquatic life use based on the stress received from anthropogenic eutrophication).For a detailed description of criteria used, see: Lake Plant Eutrophication IBI summary 2019.pdf",English,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR),State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Environment,floristic quality index|fqi|ibi|index of biological integrity|lakes,2016-07-08T10:01:58.748953,,,,Minnesota,"-95.824,44.029,-89.958,48.515",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-lake-plant-ibi,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_lake_plant_ibi/shp_env_lake_plant_ibi.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_lake_plant_ibi/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_lake_plant_ibi/metadata/preview.jpg,f8585abe-8ee3-4e63-89a1-5e9f409b7560,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE
,Lakes of Biological Significance,"This layer shows lakes meeting criteria for Lakes of Biological Significance (LBS) in Minnesota. Lakes were identified and classified by DNR subject matter experts on objective criteria for four community types (aquatic plants, fish, amphibians, birds). Unique plant or animal presence was the primary measure of a lake's biological significance. Lakes were rated and grouped for each of the following communities: aquatic plants, fish, birds, and amphibians. Lakes were assigned one of three biological significance classes (outstanding, high, or moderate), which are defined in Section 5: Attributes (below). Many Minnesota lakes have not been sampled for plants and/or animals, so this list of lakes will be periodically revised as additional biological data become available. The goal of this list was to identify lakes that exhibit the highest quality features within any of the four assessed biological communities (as opposed to identification of lakes that exhibit diversity across communities). Therefore, a lake needed to meet criteria for only one of the community types (aquatic plants, fish, birds, amphibians) to be identified as a Lake of Biological Significance. Occurrences of high-quality features within the community types determined the biological significance rank.

,Lakes of Phosphorus Sensitivity Significance,"This layer was created to identify Lakes of Phosphorus Sensitivity Significance (LPSS) within Minnesota. Available lake data were analyzed to classify lakes based on sensitivity to nutrient pollution. Phosphorus sensitivity was estimated for each lake by predicting how much water clarity would be reduced with additional phosphorus loading to the lake. A phosphorus sensitivity significance index was formulated to prioritize lakes as they relate to Minnesota Pollution Control Agency's (MPCA) policy objective of focusing on high quality, unimpaired lakes at greatest risk of becoming impaired. The phosphorus sensitivity significance index, which is a function of phosphorus sensitivity, lake size, lake total phosphorus concentration, proximity to MPCA's phosphorus impairment thresholds, and watershed disturbance, was used to determine the lake's Priority Class.The goal of this list was to objectively prioritize lakes based on their sensitivity to phosphorus pollution.

,Potentially Undisturbed Land (Virgin Sod) - FSA Common Land Unit Derived,"Project Description: South Dakota State University has developed a rigorous system for identifying undisturbed land (virgin sod) by utilizing Farm Services Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) data to determine the extent of known tillage history. Through a process of deductive assessment that incorporates USDA/NAIP aerial imagery (instead of the more common NASS satellite imagery) the project identifies and removes all tillage and physical land disturbance history to accurately identify the location of lands with the highest probability of being truly native (virgin) sod. This deductive approach is unlike any grassland modeling project ever conducted. Conservation organizations across the region are excited about the results and using the data as a key foundational 'cornerstone' tool for refining and creating protocols for targeted grassland conservation programs, species-specific research, and long-term conservation planning.

,Resilient Sites for Terrestrial Conservation in Minnesota,"This is a collection of 5 raster datasets and an ecoregions boundary file that were used to compile the report available here: http://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/centralUS/GreatLakes/Pages/Reports-and-Data.aspxThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources provides these datasets clipped to the Minnesota boundary and re-projected to UTM Zone 15N. Detailed metadata for each layer can be found here:SettingsLandscape DiversityLocal ConnectednessResilience ScoreAbove Average ResilienceBrief Summary of MethodsDetailed methods are addressed in the report. Here we provide a short summary of the key resilience inputs and analysis steps.Settings: We developed geophysical setting classifications that best correspond to important drivers of species diversity and vegetation types in the project area. This analysis resulted in a set of empirically derived and ecologically relevant geophysical settings on which we can base conservation priorities. The settings fall broadly into bedrock-influenced and surficial soil texture categories.Landscape Diversity: To create a standardized metric of Landscape Diversity we transformed two indices (Landform Variety and Wetland Scoreto standardized normal distributions (""Z-scores""with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) and then combined them into a single index. Landforms are the base score of the Landscape Diversity metric—because not all landscapes have wetlands. Where wetlands were present, if the Wetland Score was greater than the Landform Diversity Score, the Landform Diversity Score and the Wetland Score were combined. In these cases, the Landform Variety Score received twice the weight of the Wetland Score. The final map of Landscape Diversity shows the areas estimated to have the most microclimates based on Landform Variety and the Wetland score (when wetlands are present, they increase the Landscape Diversity score of flat landforms).Local Connectedness: Local connectedness measures how impaired the structural connections are between natural ecosystems within a local landscape. Connectedness answers the question: ""To what extent are ecological flows outward from that cell impeded or facilitated by the surrounding local landscape?"" To measure this, each cell is coded with a resistance weight based on land cover, and the theoretical spread of a species or process outward from a focal cell is a function of the resistance values of the neighboring cells and their distance from a focal cell out to a maximum distance (3 km). Based on the possible spread, each cell is given a resultant local connectedness value from 0 (least connected) to 100 (most connected). This score is then converted to a Z-score: The cell score""x"" minus the mean scoreof all cells ""µ"" divided by the standard deviation of all cells.Resilience Estimates: We combined the Landscape Diversity and the local connectedness scores into an integrated resilience score. To ensure that the two factors had equal weight in the integrated score we transformed each metric to standardized normalized scores (z-scores) so that each had a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (this prevents the factor with a larger mean or variance from having more influence). The formula for calculating the z-scores was: the cell score""x""minus the mean scoreof all cells ""µ"" divided by the standard deviation of all cells ""σ"".Stratification of Resilience Estimates: To arrive at a final resilience score, we stratified our evaluation of estimated resilience at three geographic stratification levels: ecoregions, settings with ecoregions, and for the entire region. The base result is resilience stratified by ecoregion. We then added in overrides to capture the most resilient areas in each setting and the most resilient areas in the region. The Ecoregional Stratification highlights the most resilient places in each ecoregion and ensures a fair geographic distribution. For the Setting Stratification, we boosted the areas with the highest scores of each geophysical setting within ecoregion. If the Setting Stratification was above average (>.5 SD above the mean) and exceeded the Ecoregion Stratification score, the grid cell received the Setting Stratification score. Finally, we wanted to ensure that the highest scoring places for resilience in the region appeared in the final map. If the Regional results were above average and were higher than the combined ecoregional and setting results, the grid cell received the value of the Regional score. The threshold for ""above average"" scores for Regional resilience included all scores meeting a ""above average"" (>1 SD) or ""slightly above average (between 0.5 and 1 SD) if the landscape diversity score was also above average. This specification ensured that areas with only slightly above average scores for the region were only included if they also have high landscape diversity. We also corrected the final scores to ensure lands with high intensity corn landuse or surface mining could not have a maximum score above .5 SD, and we also ran a spatial smoothing algorithm to improve transitional mapping within 20km of ecoregional lines.Final Resilience Score Legend: Our method identified the sites that scored above or below average in estimated resilience using the -0.5 standard deviations (SD) to 0.5 SD of the range of sites as the definition of average. Although the result is a continuous numeric number for each 30m pixel, our standard legend was as follows:Far below average (<-2 SD) Most VulnerableBelow average (-1 to -2 SD) More VulnerableSlightly below average (-0.5 to -1 SD) Somewhat VulnerableAverage (-0.5 to 0.5 SD) AverageSlightly above average (0.5 to 1 SD) Somewhat ResilientAbove average (1- 2 SD) More ResilientFar above average (>2 SD) Most Resilient",English,Eastern Division Conservation Science of The Nature Conservancy,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Environment,landscape diversity,2018-12-13T11:02:41.512066,,,,Minnesota,"-97.379,43.375,-89.226,49.428",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-resilient-sites-tnc,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_resilient_sites_tnc/shp_env_resilient_sites_tnc.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_resilient_sites_tnc/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_resilient_sites_tnc/metadata/preview.jpg,e0347c9a-f2aa-4055-bead-1f1e05904eff,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,MNDNR SNA Conservation Opportunity Areas and Marxan Conservation Prioritization,"MarxanThis data layer maps priority areas for protecting biological diversity. The data was generated using Marxan - the most widely-used decision support software for the design of conservation reserve systems in the world. Marxan has the ability to take primary input information such as the location of rare species, biodiversity areas, or mapped extent of different native plant communities and weigh against other types of information such as conservation constraints against the primary input. It then maps a result that provides the most efficient layout of a conservation system that addresses the primary conservation targets. Marxan operates by creating hypothetical mapping solutions to see how well the areas mapped in each solution provide the most efficient means of creating a conservation reserve system. As applied to this plan, the software creates 300 scenarios using 160-acre cells across each ECS subsection in the state. A cell size of 160 acres was selected since it provides a reasonable level of resolution for a state-level plan and stays within the capacity of the computers processing very large amounts of data. It conducts iterative sampling via 1,000,000 iterations per scenario to create the optimal grouping of cells that efficiently capture enough locations of conservation features to meet the target level of conservation for each designated type of feature within the study area.A target was set for each native plant community type occurring within each subsection. An example would be a target value of capturing 75% of all calcareous fens within an ECS subsection. If a solution set does not meet this goal, it can be penalized, and Marxan will go through the remainder of the 1,000,000 iterations for that scenario trying to create a better solution that captures 75% of calcareous fens. The solution seeks to meet the conservation target and minimize the amount of land required to meet all of the other conservation targets (for other NPC types) also.Other factors are also entered into Marxan such as the following:- Determining whether certain cells should be locked in or out, i.e. sometimes certain cells would always be included or excluded- Lands with high opportunity costs: Prime and Unique Farmland soils (likely to be already farmed or have a high likelihood of being converted to farmland), greater than 4% impervious surfaces in the Twin cities Metropolitan Area, and School Trust Fund lands.- The degree to which cells should be grouped together to create small, discrete sites versus landscape corridorsMarxan will try to avoid selecting cells that have high opportunity costs even if they contain rare conservation features, as this will drive up the total ""cost"" of the solution set. However, some conservation features are so rare that all locations must be selected regardless of cost. Either these features may be included at the expense of other less costly features, or their costs are so high that the selection will be very specific, resulting in virtually no areas peripheral to the conservation feature being selected that could function in a buffering or connecting capacity.One of the most useful functions of Marxan is its ability to sort through different layers of inputs and constraints to generate results at a desired level of aggregation. Marxan also has a ""clumping factor"" input that allows the project to generate results with highly segregated priority areas, or to find the optimal way to create landscape-level ""clumps"" of conservation areas. The latter approach was selected as an adaptation strategy set forth in climate change assessments.Conservation Opportunity AreasOpportunity Areas are a way of further defining the Marxan high priority aggregations as discrete planning areas to focus for conservation efforts. These areas are selected for their capacity to provide the following:- Significant rare resources, native communities, natural features, or biodiversity significance- Partners that are willing to plan, implement, and evaluate conservation actions	- Conservation that is motivated by an agreed-upon conservation purpose and set of objectives- Contributions to a conservation network that provides pathways for species mobility, which is particularly critical when addressing climate change concerns Opportunity Areas were only developed for the ECS subsections that had complete MBS data coverage. These Opportunity Areas are detailed in Part 2 of the SNA Strategic Plan.Initially, the boundaries of Conservation Opportunity Areas were drawn to capture the high and highest-priority areas (orange and red zones) from the Marxan output, and in many cases the moderate priority areas (yellow zones). This provided a base area for each Opportunity Area. Additional information layers were added to see how well the Marxan outputs protected rare or diverse conservation features, such as the National Land Cover Data set, the Element Occurrences of Natural Heritage rare features, Ecological Evaluations, and areas of biodiversity significance. Land cover was used as a layer to look at connectivity within high priority areas. This was particularly helpful in areas such as southeastern Minnesota, where strong landform patterns created by ridges and valleys can be used to provide connectivity. Ridges and floodplains are frequently cultivated, but valley side slopes also form a network that provides native forest or goat prairies that provide better species connectivity than cropped lands. Mapping workshops were held with a variety of DNR staff to refine the Opportunity Areas. In most regions, some boundary adjustments were made to include conservation features. Infrequently, an entirely new area was added and a few areas were removed.

,Visual Sensitivity Classifications,"A concern for visual quality Minnesota forests are particularly vital to the health of two industries: tourism and forest products. While many of the demands on the forests from these two industries are compatible and even complementary, concern about the specific impacts of various forest management practices on visual quality became the focus for a positive dialogue tourism and forest products industries. In the fall of 1990, representatives of the Minnesota Resort Association and the Minnesota Forest Industries began meeting to address the issue of visual quality. A Timber and Tourism Steering Committee was formed to enhance communication, promote understanding and continue to discuss common concerns. Under the leadership of the Steering Committee, public and private forestry interest came together and developed a set of visual quality guidelines. Visual Sensitivity Classification The visual quality guidelines recognized the fact that not all travel routes have the same level of visual sensitivity. To implementation of the visual quality guidelines, classification of the visual sensitivity of highways, roads, designated recreation trails, lakes, and rivers in forested areas was required. County Visual Quality Committees were formed to classify travel routes within their counties. The county committees were made up of county residents that represented tourism and forest products industries and interests. Three factors were used in the classification process:- The perceived degree of sensitivity of users of a travel route or recreation area concerning landscape aesthetics.- The volume and type of use a travel route or recreation area receives.- The speed of travel within a route or area. The levels of visual sensitivity are:Most sensitive - Applies to travel routes and areas where significant public use occurs and where the visual quality is of high concern to typical users. Examples of such routes may include public highways, local roads, recreational lakes and rivers, and designated recreational trails and areas that provide a high level of scenic quality. Moderately sensitive - Applies to travel routes or recreation areas, not included in Level 1, where visual quality is of moderate concern to typical users. Examples of these routes and areas may include public highways and local roads, recreational lakes and rivers, and designated recreational trails that provide moderate to high scenic quality but less significant public use. Less sensitive - Applies to travel routes or recreation areas, not included in Levels 1 or 2, where visual quality is of less concern to typical users. Examples of these routes may include public highways and low-volume local forest roads, nondesignated trails, and nonrecreational lakes and rivers.",English,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR),State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Environment,visual sensitivity,2014-10-07T13:08:04.084495,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-visual-sensitivity,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_visual_sensitivity/shp_env_visual_sensitivity.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_visual_sensitivity/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_visual_sensitivity/metadata/preview.jpg,2b41a813-d384-4be9-9478-0cf584fee447,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Karst Feature Inventory Points,"Southeastern Minnesota is part of the Upper Mississippi Valley Karst (Hedges and Alexander, 1985) that includes southwestern Wisconsin and northeastern Iowa. Karst lands in Minnesota are developed in Paleozoic carbonate and sandstone bedrock. A significant sandstone karst has developed in Pine County (Shade and others, 2001). Most surficial karst features such as sinkholes are found only in those areas with less than fifty feet of sedimentary cover over bedrock surface (Gao and others, 2002).Since the early 1980s, the Minnesota Geological Survey and Department of Geology and Geophysics at the University of Minnesota have been mapping karst features and publishing various versions of their results in the form of 1:100,000 scale County Geologic Atlases. In the mid 1990s, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources was assigned responsibility for the hydrogeology portions of the County Atlases and is now responsible for the karst mapping. Dalgleish and Alexander (1984), Alexander and Maki (1988), Witthuhn and Alexander (1995), Green and others (1997), Shade and others (2001), and Tipping and others (2001) published sinkhole distribution maps for Winona, Olmsted, Fillmore Counties, Leroy Township, Pine and Wabasha Counties respectively. Published atlases of Washington, Dakota, and the counties of the Twin Cites Metro area contain limited information on sinkhole occurrences.A karst feature database of Southeastern Minnesota has been developed that allows sinkhole and other karst feature distributions to be displayed and analyzed across existing county boundaries in a GIS environment. The central DBMS is a relational GIS-based system interacting with three modules: spatial operation, spatial analysis, and hydrogeological modules. Data tables are stored in a Microsoft ACCESS 2000 DBMS and linked to corresponding ArcMap shapefiles. The current Karst Feature Database of Southeastern Minnesota was put on a Citrix Window 2000 server accessible to researchers and planners through networked interfaces.The karst inventory points were point features such as sinkholes, springs, and stream sinks extracted from the karst feature database of Southeastern Minnesota.

,Peat Inventory of Minnesota,"Beginning in 1975 and continuing today, there has been a renewed interest in peat for horticulture and for fuel. This interest prompted the development of the Peat Inventory Project in 1976 to outline the dimensions of major peat areas in northern Minnesota and to determine the quantity, quality, type, and depth of the peat deposits. This is the information that is stored in this database. The DNR planned to utilize the inventory data for three purposes: to assess the horticultural potential of the state's resources, to assess the energy potential of the state's peatland, and to support a comprehensive state policy on peatland management. With the U.S. Department of Energy funding beginning in 1979, the DNR accelerated and expanded peat investigations in Minnesota. Nine data tables, stored in one Access database, record the findings of the Peat Inventory at individual peat sites in twenty Minnesota counties. The shapefile, invsite, was created from one of these tables.The first Peat Inventory report and accompanying map was published in 1979, the last report and map was published in 1982 (refer to the Associated Data Sets section for a list of these reports, listed under part 1). Recently, the reports were scanned and are available as pdf files; the accompanying published maps were scanned and rectified for use with GIS software.The map legend is included on each of the scanned map images. On the peat maps, there is basic information about mineral versus peat areas, peat depths, depths of the sphagnum moss caps (i.e., raised bogs), and a differentiation of the degree of decomposition. The USDA Soil Conservation Service nomenclature is correlated with the von Post scale of decomposition in the following manner: Fibric = H1 to H3 Hemic = H4 to H6 Sapric = H7 to H10 On the surficial geology maps (SW St. Louis includes both surficial geology and peat), the map legends differentiate peat versus other surficial geology units and peatland landforms.",English,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR),State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Geoscientific,degree of decomposition|fuel peat|horticultural peat|laboratory analysis|peat|peat inventory site descriptions|peat inventory sites|peat samples|peatland classification|peatland landforms|profile descriptions|raised bog|site vegetation|surficial geology,2019-03-13T10:02:41.525686,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/geos-peat-inventory,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/geos_peat_inventory/shp_geos_peat_inventory.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/geos_peat_inventory/metadata/metadata.html,,3ff3d17c-05c0-45d7-8d27-d71ff21e9ca1,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

The resulting network of land survey lines divided the state into townships, ranges, sections, quarter sections, quarter-quarter sections and government lots, and laid the groundwork for contemporary land ownership patterns. The township, range and section boundaries were digitized at MnGeo (formerly known as the Land Management Information Center - LMIC) from stable base mylars of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 30-minute latitude by 60-minute longitude map series (1:100,000-scale). All survey lines were extended across water bodies despite the fact that U.S. Geological Survey base maps depict them only on land. This addition allows all sections and townships to be represented as closed areas (polygons) ensuring that township and range location can be determined for any point in the state.

Line features may represent any facility or feature that may need to show the length and direction of the feature. Several examples of features that may be represented as lines include roads and trails, fence, dike, ditch or stream, drainage tile, fire breaks, water control structures, gates, culverts, bridges, docks, and utility or rail road lines.The point layer contains facilities and features for WMAs that are best represented as points. Several examples of features that may be represented as points include parking lots, water access, signs, gates, bridges, camping facilities, blinds, water control structures, feeding structures, nesting and breeding structures, buildings, reference points and cultural features.

WMA management facilities such as water control structures, restricted roads, gates and habitat structures have been removed from this layer.The facility layer should be accurate enough to provide information for management and planning activities as well as for general reference on maps. The classification system used in this inventory is intended to accurately describe the facility or feature at the time of the inventory as well as its future condition given that money is available to maintain that facility or feature. There may be plans to develop the facility to improve public access or improve habitat for desired wildlife species. WMAs have restrictions on types of public use, therefore creating maps of WMAs as general recreation or hunting areas has some peril.

,"SWCD MLCCS Natural Resource Inventory, Dakota County, Minnesota","This data set contains land cover polygons and associated attributes. From 1999 to 2003 land cover boundaries were created by interpreting, delineating, and digitizing vegetation communities and impervious surfaces. The Minnesota Land Cover Classification System (MLCCS)was used to interpret land cover types. MN DNR color infrared photography, Dakota County digital color aerial photography, and Pictometry were used for interpreting vegetation along with the following GIS data sets: national wetland inventory, county biological survey, hydric soils, physical water features, fieldline boundaries, woodline boundaries, and contours. Land cover boundaries were delineated on 1997 Metropolitan Council Digital Ortho Quarter Quads (DOQQ'S) from 1999 to 2000 (1991 United States Geological Survey DOQQ's were used for high water areas that were flooded on the 1997 DOQQ's), on 2000 Metropolitan Council DOQQ's from 2000 to 2002 and on 2002 Dakota County DOQQ's during 2003. Resulting interpreted and delineated land cover polygons were field checked where visible or accessible from roads or public property. Polygon boundaries were then digitized in ArcInfo at a 1:3,000 scale. A Minimum mapping unit of 1 acre was observed for both built-up and semi-natural and natural polygons. Exceptions: feedlots, prairies, stormwater ponds, and many wetlands were mapped at smaller sizes, and a portion of the City of Eagan extending from the southern municipal boundary northwest to 35E and east to Dodd Road to the north and Highway 3 to the south was re-mapped at a 1/4 acre mmu (only MLCCS 10,000 level codes). Partial updates were completed for: many wetland basins within the Vermillion River Watershed (political boundary) in 2006-07 during the WWIA using 2005 and 2006 aerial photography, many wetland basins within the North Cannon River Watershed (poltical boundary) in 2007-08 during the WWIA using 2006 and 2008 aerial photography, the entire Vermillion River Watershed (political boundary) in 2009 using 2008 and 2009 aerial photography, a 1 mile buffer area of both sides of all waterways within the North Cannon River Watershed (political boundary) in 2010 using 2009 aerial photography, all remaining sections of the North Cannon River Watershed (political boundary) in early 2012 using 2011 aerial photography, many areas of Dakota County north of Apple Valley/Rosemount during 2012 using 2011 aerial photography while spot checking data, all Dakota County FNAP property easements through 2013, and all BWSR approved Wetland Banks in Dakota County through 2013. In 2016, the entire North Cannon River Watershed (political boundary) was spot checked and updated section by section using Spring 2016 photography. All Dakota County FNAP and NRMP property easements to date were also updated in 2016. In 2017, the entire Vermillion River Watershed (political boundary) was spot checked and updated section by section using Summer 2016 photography. In 2018, northern Dakota County (Eagan, Inver Grove Heights, Mendota Heights, South St. Paul and West St. Paul) was spot checked and updated section by section using Spring 2017 photography.Groundtruthing:From 1999-2003 resulting interpreted and delineated land cover polygons were field checked where visible or accessible from roads or public property.

These are termed Minor Civil Division (MCDs) by the Census Bureau. The table encompases the Twin Cities 7-county metropolitan area. It is intended to be a Council wide master lookup table for these entites.

It was changed from 2393541 to 2393683 to match GNIS.- Effective April 2008, a change was made in GNIS to match the FIPS place codes to the ""civil"" feature for each city instead of the ""populated place"" feature. Both cities and townships are now ""civil"" features within GNIS. This means that the official GNIS unique ID for every city in Minnesota has changed. - As of January 1, 2006, the five digit FIPS 55-3 Place codes that were used as unique identifiers in this dataset (CTU_CODE and COCTU_CODE fields) were officially retired by the Federal governement. They are replaced by a set of integer codes from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS_CODE field). Both codes will be kept in this database, but the GNIS_CODE is considered the official unique identifier from this point forward. The GNIS codes are also slated to become official ANSI codes for these geographic features. While GNIS treats these codes as 6 to 8 digit integer data types, the Census Bureau formats them as 8 digit text fields, right justified with leading zeros included.- The Census Bureau will continue to create FIPS 55 Place codes for new cities and townships through the 2010 Census. After that, no new FIPS 55 codes will be created. Note that for townships that wholly incorporate into cities, the same FIPS 55 code will be used for the new city. (GNIS creates a new ID for the new city.)- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a Census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county.

It was changed from 2394457 to 2395708 to match GNIS.- On 11/9/2010 it was discovered that the CTU ID used for the City of Crystal was incorrect. It was changed from 2393541 to 2393683 to match GNIS.- Effective April 2008, a change was made in GNIS to match the FIPS place codes to the ""civil"" feature for each city instead of the ""populated place"" feature. Both cities and townships are now ""civil"" features within GNIS. This means that the official GNIS unique ID for every city in Minnesota has changed. - The five digit CTU codes in this dataset are identical to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) ''Place'' codes. They are also used by the Census Bureau and many other organizations and are proposed as a MN state data coding standard.- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county. Thus, a few cities in the metro area that are split by county boundaries are actually comprised of two different MCDs. This was part of the impetus for a proposed MN state data standard that uses the ''CTU'' terminology for clarity.- The boundary line data for this dataset comes from each county.- A variety of civil divisions of the land exist within the United States. In Minnesota, only three types exist - cities, townships and unorganized territories. All three of these exist within the Twin Cities seven county area. The only unorganized territory is Fort Snelling (a large portion of which is occupied by the MSP International Airport).- Some cities are split between two counties. Only those parts of cities within the 7-county area are included.- Prior to the 2000 census, the FIPS Place code for the City of Greenwood in Hennepin County was changed from 25928 to 25918.

Localized flooding locations are determined solely based on depressions in the DEM; no data of existing stormwater infrastructure is considered because this information does not currently exist at a regional scale. This layer should only be used as a screening tool. A low spot shown as a bluespot on this map does not indicate that the area will definitively flood; instead, the area has the potential to flood if a rain event is intense enough and stormwater infrastructure not sufficient.

,Observation Wells - Changes Over Time in Groundwater Levels,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) manages a statewide network of water-level observation wells. Data from these wells are used to determine long-term trends, interpret impacts of pumping and climate, plan for water conservation, and otherwise manage the water resource. Soil and Water Conservation Districts under contract with DNR measure the wells and report the readings to DNR. Monthly measurements are typically made from April through November for these wells. DNR has installed automatic data recorders in some observation wells. A set of indicator wells having at least 20 years of measurement records, distributed geographically across the state and in major aquifers used for water supplies, are tracked in monthly Hydrologic Conditions Reports. These indicator observation wells can be used to illustrate trends in groundwater levels around the state relative to the long-term records.Data for the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area are included in this dataset.",English,Metropolitan Council & Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Geoscientific,level|observation|water|wells,2017-06-21T10:02:11.475738,,,,Minnesota,"-94.012,44.471,-92.732,45.415",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-geos-obervation-wells,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/geos_obervation_wells/shp_geos_obervation_wells.zip,https://arcgis.metc.state.mn.us/server/rest/services/geos_obervation_wells/MapServer,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/geos_obervation_wells/metadata/metadata.html,,4dcae923-ad28-4932-9028-e6e796329608,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Density and Activity Near Transit,"This dataset supports planning related to policies that address density and activity in the 2040 Transportation Policy Plan (TPP). It includes geographic spatial features with applicable density policies and a separate relational data table that provides estimated Activity Levels for select geographies. Additional detail about these policies, including their application, are available in the Density & Activity Near Transit Fact Sheet in the Local Planning Handbook.The geographic file indicates where densityrequirements apply related to transit. They include station areas along existing transitways, transitways under construction, and transitways where the locations of future stations have been finalized. It also applies to stations along Arterial BRT and along local bus routes that are part of Metro Transit's High Frequency Network. Density policy varies based on the type of transit and/or Community Designations in Thrive MSP 2040.The relational data table includes accompanying information on Activity Levels for locations where this policy applies. Activity refers to land uses that can generate trips on transit. The TPP includes a guideline for minimum activity of a combined 7,000 total residents, jobs, and/or students. This Activity Level guideline does not apply to Arterial BRT or local bus routes that are part of the High Frequency Network. The table relates to the geographic file with the UNIQUE_ID field (Station name + Community Name). For stations that exist within more than one community, the table has an addition record with the station total. Transit spatial features are the unique combination of transit station areas and municipalities. These features are defined based on the proximity to transit stations or to local bus routes on the High Frequency Network. In the case of Fixed/Dedicated Transitways and Highway Bus Rapid Transit, the proximity is based on half-mile radius from a centroid of the stations platform locations. In the case of Arterial Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), the proximity is quarter-mile radius from each bus stop centroid. Centroids are based on existing infrastructure locations or the approximate location of future transit stations. In the case of local bus routes on the High Frequency Network, the distance is quarter-mile on either side of the route.Transit spatial features are transformed in three ways. Overlapping features are divided so that the data set only includes mutually exclusive features with geographic areas attributed to one station or another. However, if features with different density policies overlap, the feature with the higher density requirement supersedes the other. Features are also divided where they cross municipal boundaries. For data simplification, feature areas that are less than 4% of the total feature (i.e, station area) have been included in the feature area of the adjacent municipality.Please note that this dataset will be periodically updated. This will occur with changes to transitway priorities, programs, and funding availability. This includes anticipated changes with the 2018 Update to the TPP.

,"Generalized Land Use Historical (1984, 1990, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016)","The Historical Generalized Land Use dataset encompasses the seven county Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul) Metropolitan Area in Minnesota. The dataset was developed by the Metropolitan Council, a regional governmental organization that deals, in part, with regional issues and long range planning for the Twin Cities area. The data were interpreted from 1984, 1990, 1997, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2016 air photos and other source data, with additional assistance from county parcel data and assessor's information. The Metropolitan Council has routinely developed generalized land use for the Twin Cities region since 1984 to support its statutory responsibilities and assist in long range planning for the Twin Cities area. The Council uses land use information to monitor growth and to evaluate changing trends in land consumption for various urban purposes. The Council uses the land use trend data in combination with its forecasts of households and jobs to plan for the future needs and financing of Metropolitan services (i.e. Transit, Wastewater Services, etc.). Also, in concert with individual local units of government, the land use and forecast data are used to evaluate expansions of the metropolitan urban service area (MUSA). The Council does not specifically survey the rights-of-way of minor highways, local streets, parking lots, railroads, or other utility easements. The area occupied by these uses is included with the adjacent land uses, whose boundaries are extended to the centerline of the adjacent rights-of way or easements. The accuracy of Council land use survey data is suitable for regional planning purposes, but should not be used for detailed area planning, nor for engineering work. Until 1997, the Metropolitan Council had manually interpreted aerial photos on mylar tracing paper into a 13-category land-use classification system to aggregate and depict changing land use data. In 1997, with technological advances in GIS and improved data, the Metropolitan Council was able to delineate land uses from digital aerial photography with counties' parcel and assessor data and captured information with straight 'heads-up' digitizing with GIS software. Also, understanding that land use data collected and maintained at the county and city level are collected at different resolutions using different classification schemes, the Metropolitan Council worked with local communities and organizations to develop a cooperative solution to integrate the Council's land use interpretation with a generally agreed upon regional classification system. By 2000, the Metropolitan Council had not only expanded their Generalized Land Use Classification system to include 22 categories, but had refined how they categorized land (removing all ownership categories) to reflect actual use. See the Entities and Atributes section of the metadata for a detailed description of each of the land use categories and available subcategories. With the completion of the 2016 Generalized Land Use dataset, regional and local planners have the ability to map changes in urban growth and development in a geographic information system (GIS) database. By tracking land use changes, the Metropolitan Council and local planners can better visualize development trends and anticipate future growth needs. NOTE ABOUT COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: It is important to understand the changes between land use inventory years and how to compare recent land use data to historical data. In general, over the land use years, more detailed land use information has been captured. Understanding these changes can help interpret land use changes and trends in land consumption. For detailed category definitions, specific land use comparisons and how best to compare the land uses between 1984 and 2016, please refer to the Attribute Accuracy or the Data Quality section of the metadata. It is also important to note that changes in data collection methodology also effects the ability to compare land use years: - In 2000, the land use categories were modified to more accurately reflect the use of the land rather than ownership. Although this has minimal effect on associating categories between 1997 and 2000, is may have had an affect on some particular land use. For example, land owned by a community or county but had no apparent active use could have been classified as 'Public/ Semi-Public' prior to 2000. In 2000, land with no apparent use, regardless of who owns it, is classified as 'Undeveloped.' - With better resolution of air photos beginning in 2000, the incorporation of property information from county assessors and the use of more accurate political boundaries (particularly on the exterior boundaries of the region), positive impacts were made on the accuracy of new land use delineations between pre-2000 land use data and data collected in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2016. With the improved data, beginning in 2000, a greater effort to align land use designations, both new and old, to correspond with property boundaries (county parcels) where appropriate. In addition, individual properties were reviewed to assess the extent of development. In most cases, if properties under 5 acres were assessed to be at least 75% developed, then the entire property was classified as a developed land use (not 'Undeveloped'). As a result of these realignments and development assessments, changes in land use between early land use years (1984-1997) and more recent years (2000-2016) will exist in the data that do NOT necessarily represent actual land use change. These occurrences can be found throughout the region. There are also numerous known deficiencies in the datasets. Some known deficiencies are specific to a particular year while others may span the entire time series.

,Historic Home Owners' Loan Corporation Neighborhood Appraisal Map,"In 1934, the Federal Housing Administration created a financial mortgage system that rated mortgage risks for properties based on various criteria but was centered on race and ethnicity. This rating system propagated racial segregation that in many ways persists today.The FHA Underwriting Handbook incorporated color-coded real estate investment maps that classified neighborhoods based on assumptions about a community, primarily their racial and ethnic composition, and not on the financial ability of the residents to satisfy the obligations of a mortgage loan. These maps, created by the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC) were used to determine where mortgages could or could not be issued. The neighborhoods were categoriezed into four types:Type A : Best - newer or areas stil in demandType B : Still Desirable - areas expected to remain stable for many yearsType C : Definitely Declining - areas in transitionType D : Hazardous - older areas considered riskyNeighborhoods shaded red were deemed too hazardous for federally-back loans. These ""red-lined"" neighborhoods were where most African American residents lived. Many have argued tha the HOLC maps institutionalized discriminating lending practices which not only perpetuated racial segregation but also led to neighborhood disinvestment. Today, neighborhoods classified as Type C and Type D in 2934 make up the majority of neighborhoods in 2016 that are Areas of Concentrated Poverty where 50% or More are People of Color.

,Metropolitan Urban Service Areas (MUSA) Composite,"The MUSA Composite dataset depicts current and future boundaries of the Urban Service Areas (sewer service areas) based on communities' comprehensive plans for the seven-county metropolitan area of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The dataset does not depict the precise location of current urban services (Sewer service). In other words, the Urban Service Areas designate areas that might be serviced, it does not represent the urban areas that are serviced. The depiction of Urban Service Areas provides a framework in which known urban development and anticipated future development can exist with adequate sewer capacity at efficient service levels. Seven other datasets are derived from these data: MUSA_2020, MUSA_2020_Outline, MUSA_2030, MUSA_2030_Outline, MUSA_2040, MUSA_2040_Outline, MUSA Undesignated_Reserve (see below). NOTE: As of August 2020, the derived dataset MUSA_Undesignated is no longer being used as a desingation but remain in the Attributes for an unknown period of time for historical comparison purposes but there will no longer be a designated layer as part of any download.Each community (city or township) in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area is required to complete a comprehensive plan for approval by the Metropolitan Council per the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 (Minn. Stat 473.864, Subd 2 and 473.175, Subd 1). The comprehensive plan must include a depiction of current and future boundaries of the Urban Service Areas (i.e., 2030, 2040, Post-2040). As of March 2011, a new designation area was created specifically to address the agreed upon development plan for southeastern Scott County between the county, the city of Elko New Market and the town of New Market : 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve.' This is an area where an agreed upon acreage of urban sewer service can be added to the current MUSA by 2030 through their 2030 Comprehensive Plan. The distinction between 'Undesignated MUSA' and 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve' is that 'Undesignated MUSA' is an area within a municipal boundary defined by that municipality's comprehensive plan, whereas, 'Undesignated MUSA Reserve' is an area beyond the current municipal boundary (i.e., surrounding township) that is designated in a joint agreement by the city, town, and county to accommodate future municipal growth. Urban sewer services will not be provided to these areas until they have been annexed by the municipality (i.e., Elko New Market). Although the Metropolitan Council provides the majority of the urban sewer service in the seven-county metropolitan area, several smaller, free-standing rural communities in the region (primarily in Carver and Scott Counties), private systems, and independent nations (Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community) provide their own urban services. Where information on their urban service areas are available, it is included in this dataset. Although the information included in this dataset is derived from the communities' 2008 and 2018 comprehensive plans, subsequent plan amendments are intended to be current within 4 months, for exact MUSA information, please contact the community. When referring to CURRENT MUSA extent, this includes areas up to 2020 MUSA. For communities who have had their 2040 Comprehensive Plan adopted (Benchmark 2040), this includes areas up to 2030 MUSA.

,Metropolitan Urban Service Areas - Historical (1995 - 1998),"This layer contains boundaries of the Metropolitan Urban Service Area (MUSA) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota for each year from 1995 through 1998. Plans are to also add Local Urban Service Area (LUSA) boundaries to this dataset.A MUSA boundary line is the outer edge of the urban area. It is a line agreed to jointly by the Council and local governments through local comprehensive plan reviews. It delimits the outer reaches of regional services for the specified time period. A LUSA boundary line is the outer edge of the urban service are in rural growth centers. Rural growth centers are incorporated areas that currently provide central sewer service and that have planned long-term expansions of their urban service area. These small cities are expected to plan for a balance of housing and jobs to promote self-sufficiency. This service area boundary, like the MUSA, is agreed to jointly by the Council and local governments through local comprehensive plan reviews. It delimits the outer reaches of regional services for the specified time period. Many of the lines that define the MUSA boundary are municipal boundaries. In this layer, these lines have been derived from the County and Minor Civil Divisions layer compiled by the Metropolitan Council. Other lines in this layer have been derived from municipal comprehensive plan maps at a variety of scales and accuracy levels.NOTES: - The lines in this layer are not expected to be as positionally accurate as parcel datasets available from most counties in the Twin Cities area.- Significant errors have been noticed in the original 1995 dataset. These include missing polygons and lines that differ significantly from the parcel boundaries that actually define the MUSA. These errors will be fixed as they are encountered. See Horizontal Positional Accuracy for more information.- Additionally, areas included in the MUSA in any particular year can, at times, be difficult to determine from maps submitted to the Council prior to 1998, and do not necessarily match maps from previous years.- Some communities have 'undesignated' or 'floating' MUSAs. That is, they may have a large or undefined area within which a specific amount of land may be added to the MUSA within a given period of time. Thus, the acreage of additional MUSA has been approved by the council, but the location of that acreage will be determined in the future.

,Regional Planned Land Use - Twin Cities Metropolitan Area,"The Metropolitan Council routinely compiles individual land use plans and plan amendments from communities within the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area into a single regional data layer. A principal goal of the Regional Planned Land Use dataset is to allow users to view, analyze and display planned land use data for anywhere in the seven county metropolitan area with a consistent land use classification scheme. The Metropolitan Council uses the Regional Planned Land Use (PLU) data to help monitor growth and plan for regional services such as regional parks, transit service, and wastewater collection and treatment. Although the planned land use data is based on the locally adopted land use plans and designations for each community, it represent only data that has been submitted to the Metropolitan Council for review per the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 (Minn. Stat 473.864, Subd 2 and 473.175, Subd 1). See Data Quality Information (Section 2 of this metadata) for specifics about the Metropolitan Land Planning Act of 1995 under Completeness information. Since there is no official State or Regional land use coding scheme that communities must conform with, the variability of content and codes between communities' land use plans is nearly as vast as the number of communities themselves (187). Differences among communities can range from the implementation of different land use categories to conflicting definitions of similar categories. The PLU dataset attempts to effectively level out the variability among communities by translating communities land use categories and descriptions into a common classification scheme developed and endorsed by MetroGIS (a regional GIS data sharing consortium) participants while retaining each communities' original categories. Although the comparability of land use plans between communities has greatly improved as a result of this translation or ""regionalization"" of communities' land use codes, it is possible that not all community land use definitions have been precisely translated into the most appropriate regional land use category. In conjunction with other regional information (i.e., land use trend data, households and jobs forecasts), the PLU data can help communities more easily understand regional and sub-regional planning goals and Council staff, working with individual local units of government, can better plan for the future needs and financing of regional services. - Contact individual communities for more information on their locally adopted planned land use categories. - See Data Quality Information (Section 2 of this metadata) for specifics about the development of the regional dataset and its accuracy. - See Entities and Attributes Information (Section 5 of this metadata) for specifics about the regional land use codes and categories.",English,Metropolitan Council,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Planning and Cadastre,future land use|planned land use|planning and development|regional parcel data|regional planned land use,2015-08-28T10:01:46.941857,,,,Minnesota,"-94.012,44.471,-92.732,45.415",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-plan-pland-land-use,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/shp_plan_pland_land_use.zip,,https://arcgis.metc.state.mn.us/server/rest/services/GISLibrary/PlannedLandUse/FeatureServer,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/plan_pland_land_use/metadata/preview.jpg,3bd4dd8e-eb70-450c-846b-8b1d13b52ba0,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Transit Market Areas,"At the regional level, transit market areas approximate the level of transit service an area can support. The concept was initially developed in 1996 Transit Redesign to provide general guidelines on the mix of transit services that may be appropriate for a given area. This guidance is provided for broad regional context; appropriate transit services are defined through professional transit service planning processes. The existing market area definitions identify five market areas, with Area I supporting the most intensive transit service and area 5 supporting the least intensive transit service. Transit Market Areas were first introduced in the 1996 Transit Redesign report produced by the Metropolitan Council. They have been updated periodically since then to better reflect census geography and demographic shifts and to refine the appropriate measures of transit supportiveness.The current Transit Market Areas, developed for the 2040 TPP update, are based on an index of population density, employment density, automobile availability (population over 16 less available automobiles), and intersection density (an indicator of urban form measured as a weighted count of intersections by block group).",English,Metropolitan Council,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Transportation,transit|transit market areas,2015-09-24T10:02:02.892547,,,,Minnesota,"-94.012,44.471,-92.732,45.415",Dataset|Service,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-trans-transit-market-areas,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/trans_transit_market_areas/shp_trans_transit_market_areas.zip,https://arcgis.metc.state.mn.us/server/rest/services/trans_transit_market_areas/MapServer,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/trans_transit_market_areas/metadata/metadata.html,,8a5d9942-50fd-4b05-8102-ef60b1c270b0,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Municipal Water Supply Demand Projections,"This dataset consists of water demand projections for 2010, 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 for municipal public water supply systems in the seven-county metropolitan area. 2004 water demand data is also included to represent baseline water demand; normal climate conditions in 2004 resulted in approximately average per capita water demand. Water demand is expressed as population served by municipal systems, municipal maximum daily and average daily demand, non-municipal average daily demand, domestic (private well) average daily demand, total community average daily demand, municipal per capita demand, and the ratio of municipal maximum daily demand to average daily demand.For its 2010-2030 water supply demand projections, the Council used data submitted in 2008 local comprehensive plans. Where local comprehensive plans did not contain projection data, the water demand projection method outlined in the 2007 Water Supply Planning in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area Technical Report was used to forecast water use. While the Council does not have official 2040 and 2050 water use forecasts for each community in the metropolitan area, population for these years was projected based on the amount of remaining developable land and predicted population growth trends between 2000 and 2030. 2040 and 2050 water use was forecast using the same rate of water use for 2030 multiplied by the forecasted population for 2040 and 2050.

,Metro Regional Parcel Dataset - (Updated Quarterly),"This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees. This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate system from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. NOTICE: The standard set of attributes changed to the MN Parcel Data Transfer Standard on 1/1/2019.https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/parcel_attrib/parcel_attrib.htmlSee section 5 of the metadata for an attribute summary.Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the Metro Regional Parcel Attributes document.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.

,MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset (Year End 2006),"This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers from the seven Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington. The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. (See section 5 of the metadata). The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties will polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them.

,MetroGIS Regional Parcel Dataset (Year End 2012),"This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers from the seven Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington. The seven counties were assembled into a common coordinate system. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. (See section 5 of the metadata). The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. The primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.Polygon and point counts for each county are as follows (Updated annually, current as of 1/15/2013): polygons / pointsAnoka - 129676 / 129676Carver - 39226 / 39231Dakota - 137575 / 151343 Hennepin - 425873 / 425873Ramsey - 148889 / 166735Scott - 55480 / 55480Washington - 104957 / 104957 This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.

,Metro Regional Parcel Dataset - (Year End 2018),"This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees. This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate system from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers.

Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building.

In addition, Minnesota requires MS4s located at least partially within an urbanized area that have resident capacity, bed count, or average daily user population of 1,000 or more to obtain a permit.

,"U.S. Wind Turbine Database, Minnesota and National","This dataset provides locations and technical specifications of wind turbines in the United States, almost all of which are utility-scale. Utility-scale turbines are ones that generate power and feed it into the grid, supplying a utility with energy. They are usually much larger than turbines that would feed a homeowner or business.The data formats downloadable from the Minnesota Geospatial Commons contain just the Minnesota turbines. Data, maps and services accessed from the USWTDB website provide nationwide turbines.The regularly updated database has wind turbine records that have been collected, digitized, and locationally verified. Turbine data were gathered from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Digital Obstacle File (DOF) and Obstruction Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA), the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and were merged and collapsed into a single data set.Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in Esri ArcGIS Desktop. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations was tolerated. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and models as provided by manufacturers and project developers directly, and via FAA datasets, information on the wind project developer or turbine manufacturer websites, or other online sources. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. Similarly, some turbines were not yet built, not built at all, or for other reasons cannot be verified visually. Location and turbine specifications data quality are rated and a confidence is recorded for both. None of the data are field verified.The U.S. Wind Turbine Database website provides the national data in many different formats: shapefile, CSV, GeoJSON, web services (cached and dynamic), API, and web viewer. See: https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/ The web viewer provides many options to search; filter by attribute, date and location; and customize the map display. For details and screenshots of these options, see: https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/help/ ------------This metadata record was adapted by the Minnesota Geospatial Information Office (MnGeo) from the national version of the metadata.

The events were then categorized as one of four types: Altered, Natural, Impounded, or No definable channel, based upon a standardized methodology and criteria. These categorizations were performed manually by GIS technicians using visible interpretation of multiple years of aerial photography, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging)-based elevation data, and various other reference data in ArcGIS 10.0.Beginning in 2018, some custom linework was added to the dataset to represent streams that were not present in the NHD. These custom line features do not have a Reachcode, and have a note in the Permanent ID field and the Source Feature ID.

,Minnesota Water Table Aquifer Vulnerability,"This dataset provides a rating of Minnesota water table aquifer vulnerability. The data, methodology and ratings are based on similar work done previously by Porcher [Porcher, E. (1989), Ground water contamination susceptibility in Minnesota, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, St. Paul, Minn., 29 p.].In 1989, Porcher prepared a statewide assessment of groundwater contamination susceptibility, using the statewide Quaternary geology map that was prepared by the Minnesota Geological Survey (Hobbs, 1982). In 2011, an interagency group (MDH, MDA, and DNR) worked to find a map that would be an update to the map used by Porcher in 1989. The interagency work group decided that the statewide geomorphology layer that was produced by the Minnesota Geological Survey and the University of Minnesota at Duluth (DNR, UMD, MGS 1997) provided an updated interpretation of Quaternary materials and at higher level of resolution than the 1982 map with the addition of a Quaternary sand and gravel layer file to capture the ""Beach Sands"" in the northeast. The geomorphology layer includes generalized categories of the sediments or bedrock types that are associated with landforms and can be used to assign geologic sensitivity ratings. The ratings are based upon guidance from the Geologic Sensitivity Project Workgroup (DNR, 1991).MDA developed this dataset based on the guidance from the 2011 interagency workgroup.",English,Minnesota Department of Agriculture,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Environment,,2016-04-16T10:03:41.540243,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-aquifer-vulnerability,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/water_aquifer_vulnerability/shp_water_aquifer_vulnerability.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/water_aquifer_vulnerability/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/water_aquifer_vulnerability/metadata/preview.jpg,8e2b0095-0c1c-472f-8284-f591a8b29920,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

These WIDs are the reference the MN Pollution Control Agency uses to support monitoring, assessment, permitting, and restoration work. This dataset is subject to annual change. WIDs are not permanent IDs, and the extent of a reach is subject to change over time, influenced by factors such as water quality standards, channelization or restoration work, hydrological influence, and others reasons that influence how MPCA conducts water quality work. If the extent of a reach is changed, the WID number will also change. Historical associations are maintained by MPCA. Streams without a specific agency interest associated have an ID of '*HUC8*-999'.

,"FEMA Digital Flood Rate Insurance Maps (DFIRM), Minnesota","The Federal Emergency Managment Agency and the MNDNR produce Digital Flood Insurance Rate Maps (DFIRM) for selected counties in the state. These maps are often referred to as FEMA Floodplain maps.A DFIRM is the offical digital map of a community on which FEMA has delineated the special flood hazard areas, i.e., the floodplain areas where flood insurance is required for loans and where communities will administer floodplain regulations. (Note: Communities may regulate additional flood prone areas that are not on the FIRM).Here are some of the feature classes included in the MNDNR's publication of the DFIRM Dataset:FEMA DFIRM Base Flood ElevationsThe Base Flood Elevation (BFE) table is required for any digital data where BFE lines will be shown on the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). Normally, if there are any riverine AE zones, BFE lines are required. The BFE table contains information about the BFEs within a study area. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. BFE lines indicate the rounded whole-foot water-surface elevation of the 1-percent-annual-chance flood. The spatial elements representing BFE features are lines extending from Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) boundary to SFHA boundary. The BFE lines will have no visible gaps or overshoots between the SFHA boundary and the end of the BFE line at the publication scale of the DFIRM. However, the ends of the BFE lines are not necessarily snapped precisely to the SFHA boundary. Each BFE is represented by a single line. While BFE lines are depicted as wavy lines on the hardcopy FIRM, they should be primarily straight lines in the spatial data, although they may bend consistent with procedures described in Volume 1 of these Guidelines.FEMA DFIRM Flood Hazard ZonesFEMA flood hazard delineations are used by FEMA to designate the SFHA and for insurance rating purposes. These data are the flood hazard areas that are or will be depicted on the FIRM. FEMA DFIRM Panel Scheme PolygonsThis layer contains information about the FIRM panel areas. The spatial entities representing FIRM panels are polygons. The polygon for the FIRM panel corresponds to the panel neatlines. As a result, the panels are generally rectangular. In situations where a portion of a panel lies outside of the jurisdiction being mapped, the user must refer to the S_POL_AR table to determine the portion of the panel area where the DFIRM database shows the effective flood hazard data for the mapped jurisdiction.FEMA DFIRM Cross SectionsFEMA Cross Sections are required for any Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map database where cross sections are shown on the FIRM. Normally any FIRM that has associated flood profiles has cross sections. The corresponding attribute table contains information about cross section lines. A spatial file with locational information also corresponds with this data table. These lines represent the locations of channel surveys performed for input into the hydraulic model used to calculate flood elevations. These locations are also shown on the Flood Profiles in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report and can be used to cross reference the Flood Profiles to the planimetric depiction of the flood hazards. All cross sections for which a spatial location is available should be included in this table. The spatial elements representing cross sections are lines generally extending from outside the floodplain, across the entire floodplain and out the other side. Each cross section should be represented by a single line feature without the hexagons shown on each end on the hardcopy map. The location and shape of the lines should depict as accurately as possible the position of the cross section used. This is a modified Standard DFIRM Database table that includes Standard DFIRM Database items and Enhanced Database items. All items after SOURCE_CIT are Enhanced. The Enhanced DFIRM Database must contain all modeled cross sections, whether they are printed on the FIRM or not.Extensive information regarding the source data can be found in these two documents:FEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part A.pdfFEMA DFIRM Doc Appendix L Part B.pdf",English,Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Inland Waters,dfirm database|dfirm special flood hazard area|digital flood insurance rate map|fema|flood elevation|flood hazard zone|flooding base|floodway|sfha flood insurance rate map,2014-06-25T21:29:12.317475,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-dnr-fema-dfirm,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/shp_water_dnr_fema_dfirm.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_fema_dfirm/preview/preview.jpg,dd16ea6b-efa0-4e18-9490-c9d633c6d67f,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,DNR NextGeneration Hydrography - DNR Watercourses derived from LiDAR,"This dataset contains linear features representing watercourse segments generated from a LiDAR-derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Features are defined from confluence-to-confluence and have accurate flow direction. Watercourse IDs (DNR Kittle Numbers) are currently being added so that measured watercourse routes can be generated. Data is currently available for DNR Major Watersheds #1 - Lake Superior North (HUC8 04010101 Baptism-Brule) and #2 Lake Superior - South (HUC8 04010102 Beaver-Lester) only.Recent efforts by the DNR Geospatial Water Resources Team (gWRT) http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watersheds/wrt.html have focused on the development of methodology to derive new hydrography (i.e., watercourses, watershed boundaries) from LiDAR data sources. The increased level of detail, accuracy and currentness of the LiDAR elevation data produces features that much better reflect the current hydrography of Minnesota's landscape. This is the first vector product generated from LiDAR for inclusion into MNDNR's NextGeneration Hydrography dataset. SCALEThe Category 1 features in this dataset correspond, approximately, to DNR 24K (1:24,000) scale hydrography features and generally represent perennial and intermittent streams and ditches (although stream types haven't been determined for LiDAR-derived watercourses). A flow accumulation threshold value >= 10,000 m was used to extract these linear features from a hydrologically-modified LiDAR-derived 1m DEM (hDEM). This is equivalent to a drainage area of ~ 2.47 acres. Additional water conveyance features and flow paths were derived which meet smaller flow accumulation threshold values, although these categories are not yet complete. See Contact Person Information (below) for information about these additional features.CARTOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONThe data is presented in both original (unsmoothed) and smoothed versions. The smoothing process used was ArcToolbox: Cartography: Generalization: Smooth Line (PAEK method, 5m tolerance). This tool removes sharp angles in linear features (from the raster to vector conversion process) to improve cartographic quality. Users should note that the smoothing process can potentially move or reshape a watercourse feature in such a way that it no longer matches the original LiDAR source. A small tolerance limit (5m) was used here to minimize such errors. Results indicate that the smoothing process reduced feature lengths across the two major watersheds by a mean percentage of - 6.51% (loss). To retain true watercourse lengths for calculations, etc., the [LENGTH_MI] attribute gives the length of the original UNSMOOTHED linear feature. The [SMOOTHED_MI] attribute gives the length of the smoothed feature, while the [PERCENT_CHNG] field provides the percentage change (loss) in length due to the smoothing process.FUNDINGThis project was funded in part by the Coastal Management Act of 1972, as amended, by NOAA's Office for Coastal Management in cooperation with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources - Minnesota's Lake Superior Coastal Program.These environmental data and related items of information have not been formally disseminated by NOAA and do not represent and should not be construed to represent any agency determination, view, or policy.This project was funded in part by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency through the Clean Water Fund from the Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment.This project was coordinated to support the 2015 Lake Superior Lakewide Action and Management Plan (LAMP) goals under High Quality Habitats, ""Integrate spatial data standards and methodologies to identify and prioritize sites for habitat protection and rehabilitation and develop targeted geomatics products for lakewide action and management.""Moving Forward (2017): The gWRT is currently seeking funding to continue generation of LiDAR-derived hydrography across the state.",English,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Division of Fish & Wildlife - Fisheries Unit,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Inland Waters,hydrography|rivers|streams|water|watercourses,2019-03-14T10:02:40.981905,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-dnr-hydrography-from-lidar,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar/shp_water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar/metadata/preview.jpg,c683565b-f104-4e08-864c-b4a9d01af0fc,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

The NHD is a comprehensive set of digital spatial data that represents the surface water of the United States using common features such as lakes, ponds, streams, rivers, canals, stream gages, and dams. Polygons are used to represent area features such as lakes, ponds, and rivers; lines are used to represent linear features such as streams and smaller rivers; and points are used to represent point features such as stream gages and dams. Lines also are used to show the water flow through area features such as the flow of water through a lake. The combination of lines is used to create a network of water and transported material flow to allow users of the data to trace movement in downstream and upstream directions. The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a companion dataset to the NHD. It defines the perimeter of drainage areas formed by the terrain and other landscape characteristics. The drainage areas are nested within each other so that a large drainage area, such as the Upper Mississippi River, will be composed of multiple smaller drainage areas, such as the Minnesota River. Each of these smaller areas can further be subdivided into smaller and smaller drainage areas. The WBD uses six different levels in this hierarchy, with the smallest averaging about 30,000 acres.

The first condition includes soil mapping units (SSURGO) where the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) has determined where coarse textured soils exist. ""Coarse textured soils"" means soils that are sand, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, single grained, or any of these textures with the following textural modifiers: gravelly, cobbly, channery, and flaggy based on the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, Web Soil Survey. The second and third conditions are whether Karst (Minnesota Department of Natural Resources [DNR]) is present or shallow bedrock (NRCS) is located near the land surface. Additionally, areas were removed if they fell into the ""Very Low"" sensitivity rating from the DNR sensitivity map.There are three excluded areas: 1.) If an area is in a county with less than 3% cropland - (USDA, NASS Census of Agriculture 2012)or 2. If an area is within the climate exclusion area (NASA and Spring Frost free dates: MN Climate Office/NOAA) The climate exclusion is based on boundaries (unless otherwise stated) comprising at least 50% of the leaching index area and spring frost free dates contiguous isolines (i.e. bullseyes not included) based on the Leaching Index (LI) and the Spring Frost Free Dates(SFFD) criteria below. - If the SFFD is on or after May 22 and the Ll is less than or equal to -12 and - If the SFFD is on or after May 29 and the Ll is less than or equal to -10 and - If the SFFD is on or after June 5 and the Ll is less than or equal to -6 and - For Clearwater County the area north of Highway 2 will be excluded from areas considered vulnerable and - For Wilkin County, the area north of Highway 210 will be excluded from areas considered vulnerable.Additionally, Fall Nitrogen Fertilizer Application will be restricted in Drinking Water Management Areas (DWSMAs) that have nitrate concentrations at or greater than 5.4 mg/L provided by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). These restrictions apply specifically in the areas of the DWSMA that are rated moderate, high and very high vulnerability. The restrictions do not apply to areas rated low and very low vulnerability in the DWSMA and have been removed from the DWSMA area in this package. Approximately 603 acres have also been removed from the Verdi DWSMA since it was outside of the Minnesota State boundary.
