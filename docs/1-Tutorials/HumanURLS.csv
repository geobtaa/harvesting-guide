Within the analyzed area of about 15,000 km2, a total of about 3,600 km2 of lands appear to be flooded. Based on Worldpop population data and the detected surface waters, about 2,507,000 people are potentially exposed or living close to flooded areas. This is a preliminary analysis and has not yet been validated in the field. Please send ground feedback to UNITAR - UNOSAT.
