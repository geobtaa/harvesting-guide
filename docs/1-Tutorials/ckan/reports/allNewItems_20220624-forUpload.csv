Attributes correspond to the most recent assessment year for each lake.An IBI is a biologically-based, multi-metric method for measuring the integrity of aquatic systems. Minnesota DNR Fisheries has developed four fish-based lake IBIs that incorporate fish data collected by various methods (trap nets, gill nets, shoreline seines, and backpack electrofishing units) into 8-15 metrics in three categories: species richness, community assemblage, and trophic composition. Each metric represents an aspect of the biological assemblage structure, function, or other measurable characteristic that changes in some predictable way with increased human-induced stress. Fish-based IBI scores respond to differences in land use patterns, trophic state, and aquatic vegetation. Individual fish-based IBI scores and metrics can be viewed at Lakes with DNR Fisheries IBI Scores (Most Recent IBI Survey).Aquatic life use judgements are made for individual lakes on a rotation occurring approximately once every 10 years as part of Minnesota Pollution Agency's watershed assessment process. The fish IBI is a tool used for assessing lake impairment as part of Minnesota's 303(d) Impaired Waters assessments. Aquatic life use judgements are added to this dataset annually.

"Impaired Waterbodies, Proposed [Minnesota] {2022}","Impaired Waterbodies, Minnesota, Proposed 2022",Minnesota,"This is a set of the impaired waterbodies as determined by MPCA's surface water quality assessment process for the 2022 reporting cycle to US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Waterbodies declared impaired prior to 2022 are also included in this dataset unless they have been delisted. The waterbodies included in the dataset are made available for public comment as part of the impaired waters list. Note that for the purpose of submitting the impaired waters list to EPA, waterbodies partially or wholly within Indian reservation boundaries are published in separate datasets. The MPCA still considers these waters impaired and has an interest in restoring them. The MPCA respectfully requests that the waters partially or wholly within Indian reservations be symbolized differently on map products so that viewers can differentiate them from waters not intersecting Indian reservations. These waterbodies are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). In cases where the NHD does not include a feature that MPCA has assessed, a feature is added by MPCA. Since the impaired waterbodies are a small subset of the NHD, only that subset is included in the dataset. This dataset includes impaired waterbodies that have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA.",eng,Minnesota Pollution Control Agency,Datasets,Environment,surface water|water chemistry|water quality,2022-04-01,Continually updated resource,,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-impaired-water-2022-proposed,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_impaired_water_2022_proposed/shp_env_impaired_water_2022_proposed.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_impaired_water_2022_proposed/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_impaired_water_2022_proposed/preview/preview.jpg,587c7f1e-d2d9-490f-aa69-edfd3c2cb4d6,env-impaired-water-2022-proposed,Minnesota Geospatial Commons,05a-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,Active,CKAN,2022-06-24,,Public,FALSE,FALSE
