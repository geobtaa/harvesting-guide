,Remote Sensing Analysis of Crop Residue Levels and Cover Crop Emergence,"Soil loss on agricultural fields from wind and water erosion reduces soil productivity. Delivery of eroded sediment to nearby water resources causes turbidity and phosphorus pollution that contribute to increased eutrophication of surface waters. Minnesota rivers, streams, and lakes can be better protected from water quality degradation when agricultural practices protect against soil erosion. One practice that is effective at reducing soil loss is conservation tillage, defined as leaving at least 30% of the soil covered by crop residues at the time of planting. Another beneficial practice is the planting of cover crops that protect the soils after harvest in the fall until the next crop is planted in the spring. Remote sensing methods have been developed to assess soil residue cover over large areas accurately and effectively (Gowda et al., 2001; Daughtry et al., 2006) with imagery from the Landsat satellite and hyperspectral satellite imagery. Gowda et al. (2001) showed that regression models based on Landsat ratios for band 5 (1550-1750 nm) and band 7 (2080-2350 nm) could measure soil residue cover in the lower Minnesota River watershed with an accuracy of between 42-77%.Assessing soil residue cover at the time of planting has traditionally been accomplished using windshield surveys. This method is time-consuming and only assesses a small fraction of agricultural fields within a given county. Traditionally surveys have been conducted by local Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) staff. There is a large variability in crop residue measurements across county boundaries due to subjectivity of the methods used. There is a pressing need to develop accurate, more objective methods of assessing soil residue cover at the time of planting over wide areas of the state. Cover crops are increasingly being planted after harvest of the main crop in fall to reduce soil erosion, take up nitrogen and sequester carbon in soils that are often relatively exposed and unprotected from rainfall and snowmelt runoff. Remote sensing has been investigated as a tool for estimating the adoption of cover crop planting in the Midwestern region (Seifert et al., 2018) and Chesapeake Bay region (Hively et al., 2015). Both studies relied on fall Landsat imagery to estimate the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI), which is the ratio of (NIR-R)/(NIR+R), where NIR is near-infrared and R is red reflectance. Areas with higher NDVI were associated with cover crops. Neither study attempted to account for interference from perennial crops other than cover crops which are green in the late fall after the harvest of grain crops.Spring crop residue levels and fall cover crop emergence are dependent on many factors, such as, but not limited to seasonal precipitation and weather patterns, spring planting dates, growing degree days, fall harvest dates, and localized impacts such as crop disasters from droughts or floods. It is important to analyze annual crop conditions for the area of interest. The USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Progress Reports (https://www.nass.usda.gov/Statistics_by_State/Minnesota/Publications/Crop_Progress_&_Condition/index.php ) provide a monthly report of the field conditions and progress on planting and harvest and are the best available data for background information on background conditions.",eng,Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) and the University of Minnesota,State of Minnesota,Datasets,Environment,bwsr|clean water fund|conservation|conservation tillage|cover crops|crop residue|landsat 8|minnesota|remote sensing|sentinel 2|soil erosion|university of minnesota|water quality,2022-07-08T08:03:30.458315,Continually updated resource,,Minnesota,"-96.825,43.438,-90.836,49.268",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-cov-crop-res,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_bwsr/env_cov_crop_res/shp_env_cov_crop_res.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_bwsr/env_cov_crop_res/metadata/metadata.html,,f4ce2d5e-3e82-4a8e-b258-55f6ee8a49e1,env-cov-crop-res,Minnesota Geospatial Commons,05a-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,Active,CKAN,2022-09-22,,Public,FALSE,FALSE

,"Nitrate-Nitrogen Conditions in Private Wells Township Testing Results, Minnesota","This resource presents the final testing results by township. The initial results include data from all wells initially tested regardless of well construction or nitrogen source. Final results are determined using two rounds of sampling and a process to remove wells with construction concerns, insufficient construction information and those near potential non-fertilizer sources of nitrate. In many cases wells have been removed from the final dataset because homeowners didn't participate in the second round of testing. Final results represent wells that are potentially impacted by a fertilizer source. MDA considers <20 wells inadequate to characterize a township for the purposes of the NFMP and is denoted with <20 wells instead of a percentage.Follow the links below to the individual metadata pages for each layer:Initial Nitrate Township Testing Results: Initial Nitrate Township Testing Results.htmlFinal Nitrate Township Testing Results: Final Nitrate Township Testing Results.html ",eng,Minnesota Department of Agriculture,State of Minnesota,Datasets,Environment,nitrate|nitrogen|private well testing,2022-07-09T08:03:15.989941,Continually updated resource,,Minnesota,"-97.500,43.000,-89.000,49.500",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-nitrate-well-test,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/env_nitrate_well_test/shp_env_nitrate_well_test.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_mda/env_nitrate_well_test/metadata/metadata.html,,58a31df6-c5f2-4c41-a029-ff26a06ff8e8,env-nitrate-well-test,Minnesota Geospatial Commons,05a-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,Active,CKAN,2022-09-22,,Public,FALSE,FALSE
