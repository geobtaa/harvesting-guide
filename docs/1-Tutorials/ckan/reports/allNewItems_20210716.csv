,Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ) 1990 - 2000,"Transportation analysis zones are subdivisions of geographical areas that are delineated for travel analysis and modeling purposes. They were initially created by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. The seven county Twin Cities region is divided into 1165 zones.In most cases TAZ boundaries align with Census block boundaries. Population and household data comes from the 1990 and 2000 Census and is aggregated to each TAZ. Employement data comes from the Minnesota Department of Economic Security and is also aggregated to each TAZ.Please note that as of early 2004, this set of TAZs was no longer being used for travel demand modeling, socioeconomic forecasts and community comprehensive plan development. See contact person in Section 1 of this metadata for more information.This dataset includes attributes from both 1990 and 2000 (see Section 5 for more information).Notes:- Residential and Employment density calculations are considered to be general numbers for trend analysis metro wide. Due to limitations in the positional accuracy of TAZ boundaries and generalized land use interpretation methods, it would be inappropriate to rely on the density figures to be an accurate reflection of the employment or residential density in any given TAZ. Also, the density relates to that part of the TAZ with the given type of land use, and not the TAZ as a whole.- In August of 2003, attributes for 2000 were added to the 1990 TAZ dataset to create this dataset.- The TAZ dataset that existed prior to August, 2003 (for 1990 only) was found to have some inaccuracies in some of the residential and employment density values. They have been corrected in this dataset.- On 12/29/2000 the boundaries of TAZs 629, 632 & 633 were corrected.- TAZ boundaries that are coincident with county and municipal boundaries do not match the more accurate county and municipal boundary layer used by the Metropolitan Council.- These 1990 TAZ boundaries have significant positional differences when compared to the 2000 boundaries of the same TAZes.",eng,Metropolitan Council,State of Minnesota,Datasets,Transportation,demographics|density|employment|households|jobs|population|traffic analysis zones|traffic assignment zones|transportation analysis zones,2015-08-20T10:01:48.287663,,,Minnesota,"-94.012,44.471,-92.732,45.415",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-trans-anlys-zones1990-2000,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/trans_anlys_zones1990_2000/shp_trans_anlys_zones1990_2000.zip,http://gis2.metc.state.mn.us/arcgis/rest/services/MetroGIS/Transportation/MapServer,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/trans_anlys_zones1990_2000/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/trans_anlys_zones1990_2000/metadata/preview.jpg,cc067ae8-5932-4495-9fd4-beb5cb634d6b,us-mn-state-metc-trans-anlys-zones1990-2000,University of Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,2021-07-16,,Public,FALSE,FALSE

Note that for the purpose of submitting the impaired waters list to EPA, waterbodies partially or wholly within Indian reservation boundaries are published in separate datasets. The MPCA still considers these waters impaired and has an interest in restoring them. The MPCA respectfully requests that the waters partially or wholly within Indian reservations be symbolized differently on map products so that viewers can differentiate them from waters not intersecting Indian reservations. These waterbodies are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). In cases where the NHD does not include a feature that MPCA has assessed, a feature is added by MPCA. Since the impaired waterbodies are a small subset of the NHD, only that subset is included in the dataset.

,Metro Regional Parcel Dataset - (Year End 2020),"This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees. This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate system from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. NOTICE: The standard set of attributes changed to the MN Parcel Data Transfer Standard on 1/1/2019.https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/parcel_attrib/parcel_attrib.htmlSee section 5 of the metadata for an attribute summary.Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the Metro Regional Parcel Attributes document.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. Additional information may be available from each county at the links listed below. Also, any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person at each individual county.

,Transportation Analysis Zones (TAZ) 2000,"Transportation analysis zones are subdivisions of counties that are delineated for land use and travel analysis purposes.

The principal difference between the 1990 and 2000 systems is that 27 TAZs were subdivided into smaller units, thus expanding the total number of TAZs from 1165 to 1201. - Generally, the 2000 TAZ system utilized TIGER line files for 2000 Census blocks and political boundaries, which do not necessarily match the positionally accurate street-line files and political boundaries typically used with other Council generated GIS datasets.
