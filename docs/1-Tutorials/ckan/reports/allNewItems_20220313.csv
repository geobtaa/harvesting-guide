,DNR Hydrography - Groundwater Dominated Lakes,"The Groundwater Dominated Lakes feature class is derived from the DNR Lakes and Open Water and DNR Level 09 Autocatchment datasets. It represents lakes that have watershed area to lake area ratios of 10 or less and are larger than 10 acres. Lakes larger than 100,000 acres are excluded because they may behave differently from smaller lakes . Because of their relatively small watersheds, these lakes are likely to have a significant groundwater component relative to surface water. The watershed to lake area ratio is a screening tool that indicates the relative importance of groundwater flow to the water balance of a lake. However, the ultimate determination of whether a particular lake is dominated by groundwater flow requires more site specific information.A best first characterization of lakes into groundwater dominated or surface water dominated can be made by watershed area to lake area ratio. Lakes with a ratio of greater than 10 are likely surface water dominated. Lakes with a ratio of between 5 and 10 may be groundwater dominated, especially if the sediment around the lake is predominantly sandy. Lakes with a watershed to lake area of less than 5 are very likely groundwater dominated, either through relatively large groundwater inflow, outflow, or both. But if the sediment surrounding the lake is clayey there may be little interaction between the lake water and groundwater.",eng,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) - Division of Fish & Wildlife - Fisheries Unit,State of Minnesota,Datasets,Environment,catchment|groundwater|hydrography|watershed,2022-01-12T09:03:17.052584,Continually updated resource,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-groundwater-dominated-lakes,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_groundwater_dominated_lakes/shp_env_groundwater_dominated_lakes.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_groundwater_dominated_lakes/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_groundwater_dominated_lakes/metadata/preview.jpg,27d70f2d-a76e-4e01-b8e5-681811dfedd7,env-groundwater-dominated-lakes,Minnesota Geospatial Commons,05a-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,Active,CKAN,2022-03-13,,Public,FALSE,FALSE

,Metro Regional Parcel Dataset - (Year End 2021),"This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees. This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate system from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. NOTICE: The standard set of attributes changed to the MN Parcel Data Transfer Standard on 1/1/2019.https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/parcel_attrib/parcel_attrib.htmlSee section 5 of the metadata for an attribute summary.Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the Metro Regional Parcel Attributes document.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. Additional information may be available from each county at the links listed below.

,Special Well and Boring Construction Areas (SWBCA),"Description: The improper location, construction or sealing of a well or boring in an area of groundwater contamination may allow contaminants to spread to otherwise protected aquifers. The designation as a special well and boring construction area alerts the public, including property owners, drilling contractors, and local officials, to the occurrence of groundwater contamination, and the need to place special controls on the drilling of new wells and the modifications of existing wells. It provides information on the contamination source, contaminants encountered, aquifers affected, and necessary restrictions. It also allows affected parties, including local units of government, to be aware of and to respond to the contamination problem.The rules pertaining to the construction of wells and borings place minimum restrictions on the location, construction, repair, and sealing of wells and borings. Special construction requirements are authorized in rule and statute in areas of known or suspected contamination. In order to provide safe water it may be necessary to require the construction of deeper wells, employ special construction techniques, conduct specialized testing, or require special water treatment procedures. Contractors proposing to drill any well or boring in an advisory area must contact the Minnesota Department of Health, Well Management Section prior to construction. Contractors and property owners must submit a written request and well construction plan to the MDH and must receive written approval before construction, repair, or sealing of a well in the special well and boring construction area. A Special Well and Boring Construction Area is sometimes also called a well advisory. It is a mechanism which provides for controls on the drilling or alteration of public and private water-supply wells, and monitoring wells in an area where groundwater contamination has, or may, result in risks to the public health.

,"Sidewalk to Street ""Walkability"" Ratio","We've been asked to create measures of communities that are ""walkable"" for several projects. While there is no standard definition of what makes a community ""walkable"", and the definition of ""walkability"" can differ from person to person, we thought an indicator that explores the total length of available sidewalks relative to the total length of streets in a community could be a good place to start. In this blog post, we describe how we used open data from SPC and Allegheny County to create a new measure for how ""walkable"" a community is. We wanted to create a ratio of the length of a community's sidewalks to the length of a community's streets as a measure of pedestrian infrastructure. A ratio of 1 would mean that a community has an equal number of linear feet of sidewalks and streets. A ratio of about 2 would mean that a community has two linear feet of sidewalk for every linear foot of street. In other words, every street has a sidewalk on either side of it. In creating a measure of the ratio of streets to sidewalks, we had to do a little bit of data cleanup. Much of this was by trial and error, ground-truthing the data based on our personal experiences walking in different neighborhoods. Since street data was not shared as open data by many counties in our region either on PASDA or through the SPC open data portal, we limited our analysis of ""walkability"" to Allegheny County. In looking at the sidewalk data table and map, we noticed that trails were included. While nice to have in the data, we wanted to exclude these two features from the ratio. We did this to avoid a situation where a community that had few sidewalks but was in the same blockgroup as a park with trails would get ""credit"" for being more ""walkable"" than it actually is according to our definition. We did this by removing all segments where ""Trail"" was in the ""Type_Name"" field. We also used a similar tabular selection method to remove crosswalks from the sidewalk data ""Type_Name""=""Crosswalk."" We kept the steps in the dataset along with the sidewalks. In the street data obtained from Allegheny County's GIS department, we felt like we should try to exclude limited-access highway segments from the analysis, since pedestrians are prohibited from using them, and their presence would have reduced the sidewalk/street ratio in communities where they are located. We did this by excluding street segments whose values in the ""FCC"" field (designating type of street) equaled ""A11"" or ""A63."" We also removed trails from this dataset by excluding those classified as ""H10."" Since documentation was sparse, we looked to see how these features were classified in the data to determine which codes to exclude. After running the data initially, we also realized that excluding alleyways from the calculations also could improve the accuracy of our results. Some of the communities with substantial pedestrian infrastructure have alleyways, and including them would make them appear to be less-""walkable"" in our indicator. We removed these from the dataset by removing records with a value of ""Aly"" or ""Way"" in the ""St_Type"" field. We also excluded streets where the word ""Alley"" appeared in the street name, or ""St_Name"" field. The full methodology used for this dataset is captured in our [blog post](https://www.wprdc.org/news/measuring-walkability/), and we have also included the sidewalk and street data used to create the ratio here as well.",eng,,Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center,Datasets,Transportation,pedestrian|sidewalk|walkability|walkable,2022-01-20T14:17:08.080363,Continually updated resource,,Pennsylvania,,Vector data,Shapefile,http://data.wprdc.org/dataset/sidewalk-to-street-walkability-ratio,https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/853a077d-0a31-4292-8a1d-5d60b530169b/resource/00715f59-c979-438f-81d8-0a338ddb21b3/download/crashesped.zip,,,,,,853a077d-0a31-4292-8a1d-5d60b530169b,sidewalk-to-street-walkability-ratio,Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center Open Data,08f-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,08f-01,Active,CKAN,2022-03-13,,Public,FALSE,FALSE
