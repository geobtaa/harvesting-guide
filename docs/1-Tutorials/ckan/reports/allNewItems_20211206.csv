,"Counties and Cities & Townships 2020, Twin Cities Metropolitan Area","This is a polygon dataset for county boundaries as well as for city, township and unorganized territory (CTU) boundaries in the Twin Cities 7-county metropolitan area. It is being held static as of April, 2020 for use with Census data and other year 2020 data. The linework for this dataset comes from individual counties and is assembled by the Metropolitan Council for the MetroGIS community. This dataset is composed of three layers. - Counties = county boundaries - 2020 - CTUs = city, township and unorganized territory boundaries - 2020 - CountiesAndCTUs = Counties and CTUs combined - 2020 NOTES: - The five digit CTU codes in this dataset are identical to the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) ''Place'' codes. They are also used by the Census Bureau and many other organizations and are proposed as a MN state data coding standard.- Cities and townships have also been referred to as ''MCDs'' (a census term), however this term technically refers to the part of each city or township within a single county. Thus, a few cities in the metro area that are split by county boundaries are actually comprised of two different MCDs. This was part of the impetus for a proposed MN state data standard that uses the ''CTU'' terminology for clarity.- The boundary line data for this dataset comes from each county.- A variety of civil divisions of the land exist within the United States. In Minnesota, only three types exist - cities, townships and unorganized territories. All three of these exist within the Twin Cities seven county area. The only unorganized territory is Fort Snelling (a large portion of which is occupied by the MSP International Airport).- Some cities are split between two counties. Only those parts of cities within the 7-county area are included.",eng,"The Counties of Anoka, Dakota, Carver, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington and the Metropolitan Council",State of Minnesota,Datasets,Boundaries,cities|city boundaries|communities|community boundaries|counties|county boundaries|ctu|ctus|fips place code|mcd|minor civil divisions|municipal boundaries|political boundaries|townships,2021-09-08T08:03:23.175507,,,Minnesota,"-94.012,44.471,-92.732,45.415",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/us-mn-state-metc-bdry-census2020counties-ctus,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/bdry_census2020counties_ctus/shp_bdry_census2020counties_ctus.zip,,https://arcgis.metc.state.mn.us/server/rest/services/GISLibrary/Census2020CTUs/FeatureServer,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_metc/bdry_census2020counties_ctus/metadata/metadata.html,,4d23bf9e-8d64-4e30-99c9-dc2997b8be1f,us-mn-state-metc-bdry-census2020counties-ctus,University of Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,2021-12-06,,Public,FALSE,FALSE

,Source Water Assessment Areas,Source water assessment area (SWAA) is the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) interim surface and subsurface area surrounding a public water supply well that completely contains the scientifically calculated time-of-travel (TOT) area. The primary purpose of the SWAA is to give the public water supplier an idea of the potential size of the final Wellhead Protection Area (WHPA). The TOT for a non-vulnerable SWAA (Meth_code = FRC) is 3 years and for a vulnerable SWAA (Meth_code = AM) is 10 years. Ultimately the SWAA will be replaced by a WHPA and a corresponding Drinking Water Supply Management Area (DWSMA).,eng,Minnesota Department Of Health - Environmental Health Division - Source Water Protection Unit,State of Minnesota,Datasets,Environment,health,2021-10-30T08:02:57.710441,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Vector data,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-source-water-assess-areas,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_health/water_source_water_assess_areas/shp_water_source_water_assess_areas.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_health/water_source_water_assess_areas/metadata/metadata.html,,2bb600db-e3fd-4248-9630-fb4f782253a9,water-source-water-assess-areas,University of Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,2021-12-06,,Public,FALSE,FALSE

History:For many years the Climate Divisional Dataset was the only long-term temporally and spatially complete dataset from which to generate historical climate analyses (1895-2013) for the contiguous United States (CONUS). It was originally developed for climate division, statewide, regional, national, and population-weighted monitoring of drought, temperature, precipitation, and heating/cooling degree day values. Since the dataset was at the divisional spatial scale, it naturally lent itself to agricultural and hydrological applications.There are 344 climate divisions in the CONUS. For each climate division, monthly station temperature and precipitation values are computed from the daily observations. The divisional values are weighted by area to compute statewide values and the statewide values are weighted by area to compute regional values.

,Source Water Assessment Area - Surface Water,"The source water assessment area for community public water supply systems using surface water intakes includes three distinct nested areas. The inner emergency response area is designed to help the city address contaminant releases which present an immediate (acute) health concern to water users. This geographic area is defined by the amount of notification time the city needs to close the surface intake and a ""buffer time"" to accommodate unanticipated delays in notification and shut down. The outer source water management area is designed to enable protection of water users from long-term (chronic) health effects related to low levels of chemical contamination or the periodic presence of contaminants at low levels in the surface water used by the city. This area is intended to enable protection of users from contaminants that may 1) be usually present at treatable levels in the source water and 2) occasionally present an acute health concern under certain conditions, such as periods of high runoff or storm events. The establishment of this area also recognizes the potential for future land-use development that may influence source water. The third assessment area is the entire watershed in Minnesota. This area is designated to provide the water supplier with a broad perspective in which to prioritize specific types of land uses that may impact the water quality of the source water used. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines suggest including the entire watershed up to the state boundaries as part of the source water assessment area. Altogether, these three areas are collectively labeled the ""source water assessment area."" The entire watershed area is currently not included in the GIS dataset. Non-community source water assessment areas for surface water are also not included. Burnsville currently has a surface water intake but did not during the time period this dataset was created.
