,River Nutrient Standards,"This dataset contains two data layers: River Nutrient Regions, Minnesota and River Nutrient Regions Standards WIDs, Minnesota. The River Nutrient Region dataset shows the river nutrient regions in the State of Minnesota. Water quality standards for river eutrophication are applied to stream water units based on their relationship to these regions, though the nature of that relationship may not be as direct as a spatial intersect. Users should NOT rely solely on this dataset to determine the standard applicable to a specific waterbody. The standards, as applied, incorporate a downstream distance decay allowance. Thus, a stream flowing from the north to the central region retains the north region's standard as water moves into the central region for a distance determined by MPCA surface water scientists. In addition, there area several places in the state with reach specific criteria.The River Nutrient REgions Standards WIDs dataset indicate the River Eutrophication (Nutrient) Region standard assignment for stream water units as of the publication date. The assignment indicates which standard applies for that particular reach.The dataset includes the following layers:River Nutrient RegionsRiver Nutrient Regions Standards WIDs, Minnesota",English,Minnesota Pollution Control Agency,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Environment,assessment units|eutrophication|hydrography|minnesota pollution control agency|nutrients|surface water|water quality|wq reaches|wq use class,2020-01-22T11:02:39.638317,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-river-nutrient-standards,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_river_nutrient_standards/shp_env_river_nutrient_standards.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_river_nutrient_standards/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_river_nutrient_standards/preview/preview.jpg,36d0cbf5-a059-4743-8523-6f8169cc1e8d,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,Metro Regional Parcel Dataset - (Updated Quarterly),"This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees. This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate system from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. NOTICE: The standard set of attributes changed to the MN Parcel Data Transfer Standard on 1/1/2019.https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/parcel_attrib/parcel_attrib.htmlSee section 5 of the metadata for an attribute summary.Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the Metro Regional Parcel Attributes document.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.

The corridor extends 72 miles along the Mississippi River from the cities of Ramsey and Dayton in the north to the City of Hastings and Ravenna Township in the south. It includes 54,000 acres of land along both sides of the river. The State of Minnesota created the corridor and land use regulations in 1976. Local governments administer the regulations through their local plans and zoning ordinances. The MRCCA is home to a full range of residential neighborhoods and parks, as well as river-related commerce, industry, and transportation. Though the MRCCA has been extensively developed, many intact and remnant natural areas remain, including bluffs, islands, floodplains, wetlands, riparian zones, and native aquatic and terrestrial flora and fauna.

,Metro Regional Parcel Dataset - (Year End 2019),"This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees. This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate system from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. NOTICE: The standard set of attributes changed to the MN Parcel Data Transfer Standard on 1/1/2019.https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/parcel_attrib/parcel_attrib.htmlSee section 5 of the metadata for an attribute summary.Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the Metro Regional Parcel Attributes document.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset. Additional information may be available from each county at the links listed below. Also, any questions or comments about suspected errors or omissions in this dataset can be addressed to the contact person at each individual county.

,Resilient Sites for Terrestrial Conservation in Minnesota,"This is a collection of 5 raster datasets and an ecoregions boundary file that were used to compile the report available here: http://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/centralUS/GreatLakes/Pages/Reports-and-Data.aspxThe Minnesota Department of Natural Resources provides these datasets clipped to the Minnesota boundary and re-projected to UTM Zone 15N. Detailed metadata for each layer can be found here:SettingsLandscape DiversityLocal ConnectednessResilience ScoreAbove Average ResilienceBrief Summary of MethodsDetailed methods are addressed in the report. Here we provide a short summary of the key resilience inputs and analysis steps.Settings: We developed geophysical setting classifications that best correspond to important drivers of species diversity and vegetation types in the project area. This analysis resulted in a set of empirically derived and ecologically relevant geophysical settings on which we can base conservation priorities. The settings fall broadly into bedrock-influenced and surficial soil texture categories.Landscape Diversity: To create a standardized metric of Landscape Diversity we transformed two indices (Landform Variety and Wetland Scoreto standardized normal distributions (""Z-scores""with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1) and then combined them into a single index. Landforms are the base score of the Landscape Diversity metric—because not all landscapes have wetlands. Where wetlands were present, if the Wetland Score was greater than the Landform Diversity Score, the Landform Diversity Score and the Wetland Score were combined. In these cases, the Landform Variety Score received twice the weight of the Wetland Score. The final map of Landscape Diversity shows the areas estimated to have the most microclimates based on Landform Variety and the Wetland score (when wetlands are present, they increase the Landscape Diversity score of flat landforms).Local Connectedness: Local connectedness measures how impaired the structural connections are between natural ecosystems within a local landscape. Connectedness answers the question: ""To what extent are ecological flows outward from that cell impeded or facilitated by the surrounding local landscape?"" To measure this, each cell is coded with a resistance weight based on land cover, and the theoretical spread of a species or process outward from a focal cell is a function of the resistance values of the neighboring cells and their distance from a focal cell out to a maximum distance (3 km). Based on the possible spread, each cell is given a resultant local connectedness value from 0 (least connected) to 100 (most connected). This score is then converted to a Z-score: The cell score""x"" minus the mean scoreof all cells ""µ"" divided by the standard deviation of all cells.Resilience Estimates: We combined the Landscape Diversity and the local connectedness scores into an integrated resilience score. To ensure that the two factors had equal weight in the integrated score we transformed each metric to standardized normalized scores (z-scores) so that each had a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one (this prevents the factor with a larger mean or variance from having more influence). The formula for calculating the z-scores was: the cell score""x""minus the mean scoreof all cells ""µ"" divided by the standard deviation of all cells ""σ"".Stratification of Resilience Estimates: To arrive at a final resilience score, we stratified our evaluation of estimated resilience at three geographic stratification levels: ecoregions, settings with ecoregions, and for the entire region. The base result is resilience stratified by ecoregion. We then added in overrides to capture the most resilient areas in each setting and the most resilient areas in the region. The Ecoregional Stratification highlights the most resilient places in each ecoregion and ensures a fair geographic distribution. For the Setting Stratification, we boosted the areas with the highest scores of each geophysical setting within ecoregion. If the Setting Stratification was above average (>.5 SD above the mean) and exceeded the Ecoregion Stratification score, the grid cell received the Setting Stratification score. Finally, we wanted to ensure that the highest scoring places for resilience in the region appeared in the final map. If the Regional results were above average and were higher than the combined ecoregional and setting results, the grid cell received the value of the Regional score. The threshold for ""above average"" scores for Regional resilience included all scores meeting a ""above average"" (>1 SD) or ""slightly above average (between 0.5 and 1 SD) if the landscape diversity score was also above average. This specification ensured that areas with only slightly above average scores for the region were only included if they also have high landscape diversity. We also corrected the final scores to ensure lands with high intensity corn landuse or surface mining could not have a maximum score above .5 SD, and we also ran a spatial smoothing algorithm to improve transitional mapping within 20km of ecoregional lines.Final Resilience Score Legend: Our method identified the sites that scored above or below average in estimated resilience using the -0.5 standard deviations (SD) to 0.5 SD of the range of sites as the definition of average. Although the result is a continuous numeric number for each 30m pixel, our standard legend was as follows:Far below average (<-2 SD) Most VulnerableBelow average (-1 to -2 SD) More VulnerableSlightly below average (-0.5 to -1 SD) Somewhat VulnerableAverage (-0.5 to 0.5 SD) AverageSlightly above average (0.5 to 1 SD) Somewhat ResilientAbove average (1- 2 SD) More ResilientFar above average (>2 SD) Most Resilient",English,Eastern Division Conservation Science of The Nature Conservancy,State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Environment,landscape diversity,2018-12-13T11:02:41.512066,,,,Minnesota,"-97.379,43.375,-89.226,49.428",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-resilient-sites-tnc,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_resilient_sites_tnc/shp_env_resilient_sites_tnc.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_resilient_sites_tnc/metadata/metadata.html,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/env_resilient_sites_tnc/metadata/preview.jpg,e0347c9a-f2aa-4055-bead-1f1e05904eff,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE

,DNR NextGeneration Hydrography - DNR Watercourses derived from LiDAR,"This dataset contains linear features representing watercourse segments generated from a LiDAR-derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Features are defined from confluence-to-confluence and have accurate flow direction. Watercourse IDs (DNR Kittle Numbers) are currently being added so that measured watercourse routes can be generated. Data is currently available for DNR Major Watersheds #1 - Lake Superior North (HUC8 04010101 Baptism-Brule) and #2 Lake Superior - South (HUC8 04010102 Beaver-Lester) only.Recent efforts by the DNR Geospatial Water Resources Team (gWRT) http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watersheds/wrt.html have focused on the development of methodology to derive new hydrography (i.e., watercourses, watershed boundaries) from LiDAR data sources. The increased level of detail, accuracy and currentness of the LiDAR elevation data produces features that much better reflect the current hydrography of Minnesota's landscape. This is the first vector product generated from LiDAR for inclusion into MNDNR's NextGeneration Hydrography dataset. SCALEThe Category 1 features in this dataset correspond, approximately, to DNR 24K (1:24,000) scale hydrography features and generally represent perennial and intermittent streams and ditches (although stream types haven't been determined for LiDAR-derived watercourses). A flow accumulation threshold value >= 10,000 m was used to extract these linear features from a hydrologically-modified LiDAR-derived 1m DEM (hDEM). This is equivalent to a drainage area of ~ 2.47 acres. Additional water conveyance features and flow paths were derived which meet smaller flow accumulation threshold values, although these categories are not yet complete. See Contact Person Information (below) for information about these additional features.CARTOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONThe data is presented in both original (unsmoothed) and smoothed versions. The smoothing process used was ArcToolbox: Cartography: Generalization: Smooth Line (PAEK method, 5m tolerance). This tool removes sharp angles in linear features (from the raster to vector conversion process) to improve cartographic quality. Users should note that the smoothing process can potentially move or reshape a watercourse feature in such a way that it no longer matches the original LiDAR source. A small tolerance limit (5m) was used here to minimize such errors. Results indicate that the smoothing process reduced feature lengths across the two major watersheds by a mean percentage of - 6.51% (loss).

,"U.S. Wind Turbine Database, Minnesota and National","This dataset provides locations and technical specifications of wind turbines in the United States, almost all of which are utility-scale. Utility-scale turbines are ones that generate power and feed it into the grid, supplying a utility with energy. They are usually much larger than turbines that would feed a homeowner or business.The data formats downloadable from the Minnesota Geospatial Commons contain just the Minnesota turbines. Data, maps and services accessed from the USWTDB website provide nationwide turbines.The regularly updated database has wind turbine records that have been collected, digitized, and locationally verified. Turbine data were gathered from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Digital Obstacle File (DOF) and Obstruction Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA), the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and were merged and collapsed into a single data set.Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in Esri ArcGIS Desktop. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations was tolerated. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and models as provided by manufacturers and project developers directly, and via FAA datasets, information on the wind project developer or turbine manufacturer websites, or other online sources. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. Similarly, some turbines were not yet built, not built at all, or for other reasons cannot be verified visually. Location and turbine specifications data quality are rated and a confidence is recorded for both. None of the data are field verified.The U.S. Wind Turbine Database website provides the national data in many different formats: shapefile, CSV, GeoJSON, web services (cached and dynamic), API, and web viewer.

,Metro Regional Parcel Dataset - (Year End 2018),"This dataset includes all 7 metro counties that have made their parcel data freely available without a license or fees. This dataset is a compilation of tax parcel polygon and point layers assembled into a common coordinate system from Twin Cities, Minnesota metropolitan area counties. No attempt has been made to edgematch or rubbersheet between counties. A standard set of attribute fields is included for each county. The attributes are the same for the polygon and points layers. Not all attributes are populated for all counties. NOTICE: The standard set of attributes changed to the MN Parcel Data Transfer Standard on 1/1/2019.https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/committee/standards/parcel_attrib/parcel_attrib.htmlSee section 5 of the metadata for an attribute summary.Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the Metro Regional Parcel Attributes document.The polygon layer contains one record for each real estate/tax parcel polygon within each county's parcel dataset. Some counties have polygons for each individual condominium, and others do not. (See Completeness in Section 2 of the metadata for more information.) The points layer includes the same attribute fields as the polygon dataset. The points are intended to provide information in situations where multiple tax parcels are represented by a single polygon. One primary example of this is the condominium, though some counties stacked polygons for condos. Condominiums, by definition, are legally owned as individual, taxed real estate units. Records for condominiums may not show up in the polygon dataset. The points for the point dataset often will be randomly placed or stacked within the parcel polygon with which they are associated. The polygon layer is broken into individual county shape files. The points layer is provided as both individual county files and as one file for the entire metro area.In many places a one-to-one relationship does not exist between these parcel polygons or points and the actual buildings or occupancy units that lie within them. There may be many buildings on one parcel and there may be many occupancy units (e.g. apartments, stores or offices) within each building. Additionally, no information exists within this dataset about residents of parcels. Parcel owner and taxpayer information exists for many, but not all counties.This is a MetroGIS Regionally Endorsed dataset.

The classification of various wetland types were made in consultation with wetland professionals from several state and federal agencies and from academia and were helpful in discussing the potential effects of groundwater withdrawals. However, they are based on best professional judgment, not empirical data, and are subject to revision and further clarification. The basic units of classification are the wetland native plant communities (NPC) as described in the series of Field Guides to the Native Plant Communities of Minnesota (MnDNR 2005a, 2005b, 2003). The NPCs are grouped into readily recognizable wetland type categories.

,Peat Inventory of Minnesota,"Beginning in 1975 and continuing today, there has been a renewed interest in peat for horticulture and for fuel. This interest prompted the development of the Peat Inventory Project in 1976 to outline the dimensions of major peat areas in northern Minnesota and to determine the quantity, quality, type, and depth of the peat deposits. This is the information that is stored in this database. The DNR planned to utilize the inventory data for three purposes: to assess the horticultural potential of the state's resources, to assess the energy potential of the state's peatland, and to support a comprehensive state policy on peatland management. With the U.S. Department of Energy funding beginning in 1979, the DNR accelerated and expanded peat investigations in Minnesota. Nine data tables, stored in one Access database, record the findings of the Peat Inventory at individual peat sites in twenty Minnesota counties. The shapefile, invsite, was created from one of these tables.The first Peat Inventory report and accompanying map was published in 1979, the last report and map was published in 1982 (refer to the Associated Data Sets section for a list of these reports, listed under part 1). Recently, the reports were scanned and are available as pdf files; the accompanying published maps were scanned and rectified for use with GIS software.The map legend is included on each of the scanned map images. On the peat maps, there is basic information about mineral versus peat areas, peat depths, depths of the sphagnum moss caps (i.e., raised bogs), and a differentiation of the degree of decomposition. The USDA Soil Conservation Service nomenclature is correlated with the von Post scale of decomposition in the following manner: Fibric = H1 to H3 Hemic = H4 to H6 Sapric = H7 to H10 On the surficial geology maps (SW St. Louis includes both surficial geology and peat), the map legends differentiate peat versus other surficial geology units and peatland landforms.",English,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR),State of Minnesota,Geospatial data,Geoscientific,degree of decomposition|fuel peat|horticultural peat|laboratory analysis|peat|peat inventory site descriptions|peat inventory sites|peat samples|peatland classification|peatland landforms|profile descriptions|raised bog|site vegetation|surficial geology,2019-03-13T10:02:41.525686,,,,Minnesota,"-97.230,43.500,-89.530,49.370",Dataset,Vector,Shapefile,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/geos-peat-inventory,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/geos_peat_inventory/shp_geos_peat_inventory.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/geos_peat_inventory/metadata/metadata.html,,3ff3d17c-05c0-45d7-8d27-d71ff21e9ca1,Minnesota,05a-01,05a-01,Active,CKAN,,Public,,FALSE,FALSE
,State Funded Best Management Practices - BWSR (eLINK),"These data represent mapped features of best management practices (BMPS) from the Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) eLINK grant reporting system from 2003 to recent. The data represents structure practices from a wide range of BMPs that have been mapped through eLINK map interface. BMPs are mapped as points, lines, or polygons depending on the practice type, indicated in the attribute table as FEATURE_TYPE. In this data set, all those features mapped into distinct feature classes have been generalized as points, and combined into a single layer. A point feature has been assigned at the centroid of the line and polygon features. This dataset only includes BMPs that are connected with completed and closed grants, not activities considered ""in progress"".The eLINK grants reporting system was originally launched in 2003 and has undergone subsequent updates in 2005, 2009 and 2013. In 2013, the database structure was changed significantly and data before 2013 may have more limited attributes depending on the BMP practice type. In addition, not all practice types and actions associated with BWSR grants have a geospatial element. Thus, not every practice or grant will be represented in the geospatial data. The eLINK data represents BWSR grants funded through BWSR via the State General Fund, Clean Water Fund, and Bonding funds. Practices funded through the MPCA Clean Water Partnership and 319 programs are also included. This data set does not include BWSR Reinvest in Minnesota (RIM) easements, which are collected in a database outside of eLINK.
