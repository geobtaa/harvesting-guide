### Getting Started With GitHub

GitHub is a collaborative web-based platform designed around version control. It allows multiple people to work on projects at once, tracking and merging their changes. Hereâ€™s a short tutorial to get you up and running:

**Step 1: Creating a GitHub Account**

Visit the following link and fill out the required fields to set up your free account: https://github.com/join

**Step 2: Understanding Key Terms**

- **Repositories:** A GitHub repository (or repo) is like a folder for your project. It contains all the project files, issues, pull requests, and other important information.

- **Branches:** A branch is a version of your repository, or in other words, an independent line of development. You can think of it as a unique set of code changes with a unique name. The "main" branch is the default one, usually where all changes eventually get merged into.

- **Pull Requests:** Pull requests are how you propose changes. They are requests to merge code from one branch into another. It's also a place for teams to discuss the proposed changes.

- **Commits:** Commits are individual changes to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID allowing you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.   

**Step 3: Creating a New Repository**

To create a new repo, click the '+' sign in the top right of any GitHub page, then select 'New repository'. Name your repository, write a short description, and keep the repository public. Ignore the other options for now and click 'Create repository'.

**Step 4: Creating a New Branch**

To create a branch in your repository, go to your new repository's page and click the dropdown at the top of the file list that says 'branch: main'. Type a branch name into the new branch text box and select the blue 'Create branch' box.

**Step 5: Making and Committing Changes**

Choose the README.md file in your new branch, click the pencil icon in the top right to edit it. Write a bit about yourself and then scroll down and click the 'Commit changes' button.

**Step 6: Opening a Pull Request**

On the main page, click the 'Pull Request' tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green 'New pull request' button. In the 'Example Comparisons' box, select the branch you made earlier to compare with the main branch.

**Step 7: Merging your Pull Request**

In this final step, click the green 'Merge pull request' button then the 'Confirm Merge' button. This will merge your changes from your branch into the main branch. Lastly, you can delete your branch as its changes have been incorporated with the 'Delete branch' button.

Congratulations! You've created a project, opened a pull request, merged code, and explored the pull request cycle.
