### Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks are user-friendly interfaces for running Python scripts that interleave code, visuals, and markdown into a single, neat workspace. They are widely used in data science, teaching programming, scientific computing, and many other academic or commercial domains. Here’s how you can get started with Jupyter notebooks:

**Step 1: Installing Jupyter Notebook**

Jupyter notebooks depend on Python. So, if you haven't installed Python yet, you'll need to do so first. 

We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution, which includes Python, the Jupyter Notebook, and other commonly used packages for scientific computing and data science. 

Follow the link to download Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section

After downloading Anaconda, you can install it by double-clicking the downloaded file and then following the prompts. You don’t need to change any of the default settings.

**Step 2: Running Jupyter Notebook**

To run the Jupyter Notebook, you can either use Anaconda Navigator or use a terminal/command prompt:

- To use Anaconda Navigator, simply open it, and then select Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator home menu. Then a new tab in your browser will open with the Jupyter homepage.

- To use the terminal/command prompt, simply open it, and navigate (using the `cd` command) to the directory that you want to work from. Then run the command `jupyter notebook`. Your web browser will pop up with the Jupyter homepage.

**Step 3: Overview of Cells**

Jupyter notebooks consist of a sequence of cells. A cell is a multiline text input field, and its contents can be executed by using Shift-Enter, or by clicking either the “Play” button in the toolbar, or Cell, Run in the menu bar. The execution behavior of a cell is determined by the cell’s type. There are four types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, raw cells and heading cells.

- **Code Cells:** These cells allow you to write and execute programming code. They allow for Python code by default, but also support many other languages.

- **Markdown Cells:** These cells allow you to write text that includes equations, images, hyperlinks etc. They are used for documentation.

- **Raw Cells:** Raw cells provide a place in which you can write output directly. They are not evaluated by the notebook.

- **Heading Cells:** These cells are deprecated. In older versions of Jupyter, these cells were used to structure a notebook as different sections. Now, they’ve replaced the functionality of heading cells with markdown.
