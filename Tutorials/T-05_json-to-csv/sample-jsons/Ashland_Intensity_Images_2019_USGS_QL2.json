 "dc_description_s": "This data represents LiDAR-derived intensity images (QL2) for Ashland County, Wisconsin in 2019 (QL2 data â€“ lower resolution with 2 points per square meter). LiDAR intensity is recorded as the return strength of a laser beam. It is a bi-product, provided as an integer number between 1-256. This number varies with the composition of the surface object reflecting the laser beam. A low number indicates low reflectivity while a high number indicates high reflectivity. The intensity of the laser beam return can also be affected by the angle of arrival (scan angle), range, surface composition, roughness, and moisture content.",
