Wetlands [Pennsylvania--York County],Wetlands,"This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States. These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.",eng,"This dataset was automatically cataloged from the provider's ArcGIS Hub.

To implement this goal, the Plan recommends creating a dynamic and updateable inventory of all parcels that are vacant, undeveloped, underutilized, and zoned for economic development. The anticipated result would bea listing of parcels that are 2 or more acres in size and are ranked by suitability based on available infrastructure, services, and other factors determined to increase the economic development potential of the parcels. Areas within Established Rural Areas that are zoned properly would be included for consideration. The results of the land assessment will be made accessible for public and municipal use. This Economic Development Application tool is the result of the actions identified by the York County Economic Action Plan through outreach to businesses, residents, and other entities. We hope you will use the tool to become familiar with economic development potential in York County, identify future economic development needs, catalyze planning discussions, identify potential infrastructure investments, and assist with decision making.
