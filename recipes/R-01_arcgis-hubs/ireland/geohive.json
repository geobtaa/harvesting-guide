This requires the creation of suburbs and extensions to existing cities and legal towns, as well as delineating boundaries for settlements which are not legally defined (called Census towns). From 1971 to 2006, Census towns were defined as a cluster of fifty or more occupied dwellings where, within a radius of 800 metres there was a nucleus of thirty occupied dwellings (on both sides of a road, or twenty on one side of a road), along with a clearly defined urban centre e.g. a shop, a school, a place of worship or a community centre. Census town boundaries where extended over time where there was an occupied dwelling within 200 metres of the existing boundary. To avoid the agglomeration of adjacent towns caused by the inclusion of low density one off dwellings on the approach routes to towns, the 2011 criteria were tightened, in line with UN criteria. In Census 2011 a new Census town was defined as being a cluster with a minimum of 50 occupied dwellings, with a maximum distance between any dwelling and the building closest to it of 100 metres, and where there was evidence of an urban centre (shop, school etc). The proximity criteria for extending existing 2006 Census town boundaries was also amended to include all occupied dwellings within 100 metres of an existing building. Other information based on Tailte Éireann mapping and orthogonal photography was taken into account when extending boundaries. Boundary extensions were generally made to include the land parcel on which a dwelling was built or using other physical features such as roads, paths etc. Extensions to the environs and suburbs of legal towns and cities were also constructed using the 100 metre proximity rule applied to Census towns. For census reports, urban settlements are towns with a population of 1,500 or more, while settlements with a population of less than 1,500 are classified as rural.</font></div>",

This approach utilised national in-situ geo-spatial information on agriculture, forestry and water bodies from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), the Forest Service, Coillte and the EPA. These data sources were used alongside remote sensing based interpretation of satellite imagery to extensively revise the 2006 CORINE dataset, improving the spatial delineation (boundaries) of landcover features and also their internal thematic classification.</span><br /><br /><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:14px;'>The 2006-2012 change dataset then mapped any changes &gt; 5ha within the reference period of 2006-2012, also making use of up to-date national in-situ vector data. The change dataset was integrated into the revised 2006 dataset to produce the new 2012 landcover update dataset. By revising the 2006 dataset first then mapping changes on from this dataset, accurate statistics on landcover change were produced whilst at the same time ensuring that revisions undertaken on the 2006 dataset were carried through to the 2012 dataset.</span><div><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:14px;'><br /></span></div><div><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:14px;'>For more information on this dataset please go to </span><a href='https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/80b6079f-1cac-4b00-9936-cebdbc90103a' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/80b6079f-1cac-4b00-9936-cebdbc90103a</a></div>",

Developing earlier\nwork conducted by An Foras Talúntais, the project generated soil-landscape\nmodels for previously surveyed counties. These soil-landscape (‘soilscape’)\nmodels formed the basis for training statistical ‘inference engines’ for\npredicting soil mapping units, checked during field survey. 213 soil series are\nidentified, each with differing characteristics, having contrasting\nenvironmental and agronomic responses. Properties were recorded in a database\nable to satisfy national and EU policy requirements. The Irish soil map and\nrelated soil property data will also serve public interest, providing the means\nto learn online about Irish soil resources.

The maritime climate of Ireland drives wet soil conditions, such that\nexcess soil moisture in combination with heavy textured soils is considered a\nkey constraint in relation to achieving productivity and environmental targets.\nBoth soil moisture content and the rate at which water drains from the soil are\ncritical indicators of soil physical quality and the overall functional\ncapacity of soil. Therefore, a natural extension to the Irish Soil Information\nSystem included the development of an indicative soil drainage map for Ireland.\nThe soil subgroup map was used to develop the indicative drainage map, based on\ndiagnostic criteria relating to the subgroup categorization. Use the Symbology\nlayer file 'SOIL_SISSoilDrainage.lyr' based on Value Field 'Drainage'.</span></span></p><p><span style='font-size:10.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#333333;'><br />\n<span style='background:white;'><span style='font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; text-align:start; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial; word-spacing:0px;'>SIS SOIL DEPTH: Soil depth is a measure of the thickness of\nthe soil cover and reflects the relationship between parent material and length\nof soil forming processes. Soil depth determines the potential rooting depth of\nplants and any restrictions within the soil that may hinder rooting depth.\nPlants derive nearly 80 per cent of their water needs from the upper part of\nthe soil solum, i.e. where the root system is denser. The rooting depths depend\non plant physiology, type of soil and water availability. Generally, vegetables\n(beans, tomatoes, potatoes, parsnip, carrots, leek, broccoli, etc.) are shallow\nrooted, about 50–60 cm; fruit trees and some other plants have medium rooting\ndepths, 70–120 cm and other crops such as barley, wheat, oats, and maize may\nhave deeper roots. Furthermore, rooting depths vary according to the age of the\nplants. The exact soil depth is difficult to define accurately due to its high\nvariability across the landscape. The effective soil depth can be reduced by\nthe presence of bedrock or impermeable layers. Use the Symbology layer file\n'SOIL_SISSoilDepth.lyr' based on Valued Field 'Depth'.</span></span></span></p><p><span style='font-size:10.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#333333;'><br />\n<span style='background:white;'><span style='font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; text-align:start; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial; word-spacing:0px;'>SIS SOIL TEXTURE:Soil texture is an important soil\ncharacteristic that influences processes such as water infiltration rates,\nrootability, gas exchanges, leaching, chemical activity, susceptibility to\nerosion and water holding capacity. The soil textural class is determined by\nthe percentage of sand, silt, and clay. Soil texture also influences how much\nwater is available to the plant; clay soils have a greater water holding\ncapacity than sandy soils. Use the Symbology layer file\n'SOIL_SISSoilTexture.lyr' based on Value Field 'Texture'.</span></span></span></p><p><span style='font-size:10.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#333333;'><br />\n<span style='background:white;'><span style='font-variant-ligatures:normal; font-variant-caps:normal; text-align:start; text-decoration-style:initial; text-decoration-color:initial; word-spacing:0px;'>SIS SOIL SOC:In the previous national soil survey conducted\nby An Foras Taluntais, 14 counties were described in detail with soil profile\ndescriptions provided for the representative soil series found within a county.\nSoil samples were taken at each soil horizon to a depth of 1 meter and analyses\nperformed for a range of measurements, including soil organic carbon, texture,\ncation exchange capacity, pH; however in most cases no bulk density\nmeasurements were taken. This meant that while soil organic carbon\nconcentrations were available this could not be related to a stock for a given\nsoil series. In 2012/2013, 246 profile pits were sampled and analysed as part\nof the Irish Soil Information System project to fill in gaps in the description\nof representative profile data for Ireland. Use the Symbology layer file\n'SOIL_SISSoilSOC.lyr' based on Value Field 'SOC'. </span></span></span></p>",

Soil survey maps, Quaternary maps and published and unpublished\nreports were complied and boundaries between sediment types are interpreted and\nmapped using photo-interpretation in a soft copy photogrammetric workstation\nwith digital stereo-pairs of black and white photography acquired at a scale of\n1:40,000. Fieldwork was carried out, around the flanks of large bogs delineate\nthe exact boundary between peat and mineral soils but predominantly within the\nboundary zones of differencing subsoils. Areas mapped during the\nphotogrammetric analysis were also checked during the fieldwork. Methods\nadopted during field mapping include reconnaissance mapping, auger sampling,\ntrenching, digital photography and GPS data recording. Aerial photography\ndatasets involved in mapping were acquired in 1995 while field data collected\nwas collected during 1998-2005.The classification of subsoils is based on the classification\nused by the Geological Survey of Ireland Quaternary Section in mapping\nQuaternary sediment types.This classification has been altered only to ensure\nutility specific to the requirements of the EPA Soil and Subsoil Mapping\nProject.

The layer has been developed as a proxy to represent SDG 9.1.2 'Passenger and Freight Volumes, by Mode of Transport' for Ireland. The layer was created using data produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) as part of the Road Freight Transport Survey 2016 and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann.Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the\nformer Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation\n(EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission\nRegulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info).\n\nIn 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 9 which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.",

The risk of not meeting WFD objectives was determined by assessment of monitoring data, data on the pressures and data on the measures that have been implemented. Waterbodies that are At Risk are prioritised for implementation of measures. This assessment was completed in 2020 by the EPA Catchments Unit in conjunction with other public bodies and was primarily based on monitoring data up the end of 2018.</p><p style='box-sizing:border-box; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'>The three risk categories are: <em>Waterbodies that are At Risk of not meeting their Water Framework Directive objectives. For these waterbodies an evidence-based process was undertaken to identify the significant pressures; once a pressure is designated as ‘significant’, measures and accompanying resources are needed to mitigate the impact(s) from this pressure. These At Risk waterbodies require not only implementation of the existing measures described in the various regulations, e.g. the Good Agricultural Practices Regulations, but also in many instances more targeted supplementary measures. </em>Waterbodies that are categorised as Review either because additional information is needed to determine their status before resources and more targeted measures are initiated or the measures have been undertaken, e.g. a wastewater treatment plant upgrade, but the outcome hasn’t yet been measured/monitored. * Waterbodies that are Not at Risk and therefore are meeting their Water Framework Directive objectives. These require maintenance of existing measures to protect the satisfactory status of the water bodies.</p><p style='box-sizing:border-box; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px;'><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'>For more information on this dataset please go to </span><a href='https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/09f36d27-d59c-4ba9-bbdf-9b8c20362cad' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/09f36d27-d59c-4ba9-bbdf-9b8c20362cad</a><br /></p>",

The risk of not meeting WFD objectives was determined by assessment of monitoring data, data on the pressures and data on the measures that have been implemented. Waterbodies that are At Risk are prioritised for implementation of measures. This assessment was completed in 2020 by the EPA Catchments Unit in conjunction with other public bodies and was primarily based on monitoring data up the end of 2018.</p><p style='box-sizing:border-box; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'>The three risk categories are: <em>Waterbodies that are At Risk of not meeting their Water Framework Directive objectives. For these waterbodies an evidence-based process was undertaken to identify the significant pressures; once a pressure is designated as ‘significant’, measures and accompanying resources are needed to mitigate the impact(s) from this pressure. These At Risk waterbodies require not only implementation of the existing measures described in the various regulations, e.g. the Good Agricultural Practices Regulations, but also in many instances more targeted supplementary measures. </em>Waterbodies that are categorised as Review either because additional information is needed to determine their status before resources and more targeted measures are initiated or the measures have been undertaken, e.g. a wastewater treatment plant upgrade, but the outcome hasn’t yet been measured/monitored. * Waterbodies that are Not at Risk and therefore are meeting their Water Framework Directive objectives. These require maintenance of existing measures to protect the satisfactory status of the water bodies.</p><p style='box-sizing:border-box; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'>For more information on this dataset please go to <a href='https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/97c629e1-2c39-4d83-8ac6-08a943d41d42' style='font-family:&quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:15px;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/97c629e1-2c39-4d83-8ac6-08a943d41d42</a></p>",

Attributes include a breakdown by sex and region. The layer was created using data produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) as part of the CSO's Labour Force Survey Q4 2017 and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann. Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the\nformer Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation\n(EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission\nRegulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info).\n\nIn 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 9 which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.

The geometry is generated by merging the river lines of individual geometric network datasets. This layer contains an integrated flow network that includes known flow connections through rivers, lakes and groundwater aquifers. In places where the network is depicted flowing through lakes or through underground channels, the flow channels are schematic only, and do not represent the precise location of these flow channels. The appropriate Geological Survey Ireland data sets should be consulted where underground flows or connections are known or suspected.</span><div><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'><br /></span></div><div><p style='background:white;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#4C4C4C;'>This dataset\nis provided by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  For more\ninformation please see <a href='https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c4043e19-38ec-4120-a588-8cd01ac94a9c' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>https://gis.epa.ie/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/c4043e19-38ec-4120-a588-8cd01ac94a9c</a></span></p><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'></span></div>",

The layer has been developed as a proxy to represent SDG 8.5.2 ‘Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities' for Ireland. Census 2016 data produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and Electoral Division boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann were used to create this feature layer. Census 2016 Principal Economic Status is used to define unemployment.In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 8  which aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

The layer was created using data from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann. The dataset includes figures for 2004, 2009 and 2014. Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the\nformer Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation\n(EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission\nRegulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info).\n\nIn 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 5 which aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.",

These land divisions were formed following the Norman invasion of Ireland in imitation of the counties then in use as units of local government in the Kingdom of England. The older term &quot;shire&quot; was historically equivalent to &quot;county&quot;. The principal function of the county was to impose royal control in the areas of taxation, security and the administration of justice at local level. Following a survey under the 1825 Boundary Survey Act, an extensive series of maps of Ireland was created by the Irish division of the Tailte Éireann for taxation purposes.

			"description": "<div style='text-align:left;'><p><span style='font-size:12pt;'>In order to distinguish between the urban and rural population for census analysis, the boundaries of distinct settlements need to be defined. This requires the creation of suburbs and extensions to existing cities and legal towns, as well as delineating boundaries for settlements which are not legally defined (called Census towns). From 1971 to 2006, Census towns were defined as a cluster of fifty or more occupied dwellings where, within a radius of 800 metres there was a nucleus of thirty occupied dwellings (on both sides of a road, or twenty on one side of a road), along with a clearly defined urban centre e.g. a shop, a school, a place of worship or a community centre. Census town boundaries where extended over time where there was an occupied dwelling within 200 metres of the existing boundary. To avoid the agglomeration of adjacent towns caused by the inclusion of low density one off dwellings on the approach routes to towns, the 2011 criteria were tightened, in line with UN criteria. In Census 2011 a new Census town was defined as being a cluster with a minimum of 50 occupied dwellings, with a maximum distance between any dwelling and the building closest to it of 100 metres, and where there was evidence of an urban centre (shop, school etc). The proximity criteria for extending existing 2006 Census town boundaries was also amended to include all occupied dwellings within 100 metres of an existing building. Other information based on </span><span style='font-size:16px;'>Tailte Éireann</span><span style='font-size:12pt;'> mapping and orthogonal photography was taken into account when extending boundaries. Boundary extensions were generally made to include the land parcel on which a dwelling was built or using other physical features such as roads, paths etc. Extensions to the environs and suburbs of legal towns and cities were also constructed using the 100 metre proximity rule applied to Census towns. For census reports, urban settlements are towns with a population of 1,500 or more, while settlements with a population of less than 1,500 are classified as rural.</span></p><p><span style='font-size:16px;'>This dataset is provided by Tailte Éireann </span><br /></p></div>",

Generated using two bespoke algorithms which incorporated the ED and Townland boundaries, ortho-photography, large scale vector data and GeoDirectory data. Before the 2011 census they were split in relation to motorways and dual carriageways. After the census some boundaries were merged and other divided to maintain privacy of the residential area occupants.

The ships collect bathymetry data. Bathymetry is the measurement of how deep the sea is. Bathymetry is the study of the shape and features of the seabed.

The boats use special equipment called a multibeam echosounder. A multibeam echosounder is a type of sonar that is used to map the seabed. Sound waves are emitted in a fan shape beneath the boat. The amount of time it takes for the sound waves to bounce off the bottom of the sea and return to a receiver is used to find out the water depth. The strength of the sound wave is used to find out how hard the bottom of the sea is. A strong sound wave indicates a hard surface (rocks, gravel), and a weak signal indicates a soft surface (silt, mud). The word backscatter comes from the fact that different bottom types “scatter” sound waves differently.</span></span></p><p style='text-align:Justify;margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Using the equipment also allows predictions as to the type of material present on the seabed e.g. rocks, pebbles, sand, mud. To confirm this, sediment samples are taken from the seabed. This process is called ground-truthing or sampling.</span></span></p><p style='text-align:Justify;margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Grab sampling is the most popular method of ground-truthing. There are three main types of grab used depending on the size of the vessel and the weather conditions; Day Grab, Shipek or Van Veen Grabs. The grabs take a sample of sediment from the surface layer of the seabed. The samples are then sent to a lab for analysis. Particle size analysis (PSA) has been carried out on samples collected since 2004. The results are used to cross-reference the seabed sediment classifications that are made from the bathymetry and backscatter datasets and are used to create seabed sediment maps (mud, sand, gravel, rock). </span></span></p><p style='text-align:Justify;margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Sediments have been classified based on percentage sand, mud and gravel (after Folk 1954).</span></span></p><p style='text-align:Justify;margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>This dataset show locations that have completed samples from the seabed around Ireland.

Over much of Ireland, the bedrock is covered by materials such as soil and gravel.  The Bedrock map shows what the land surface of Ireland would be made up of if these materials were removed. As the bedrock is commonly covered, bedrock maps are an interpretation of the available data. </SPAN></SPAN></P><P STYLE=\"margin:0 0 14 0;\"><SPAN><SPAN>Geologists map and record information on the composition and structure of rock outcrops (rock which can be seen on the land surface) and boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground).

Faults and folds are the result of great pressure being applied to rock across a whole continent or more. These rocks will either break under the pressure, forming faults, or they will bend to form folds. Faults are recorded in the Geological Lines layer as lines where the break in the rock meets the surface. Folds are shown only using the lines of their axes, synclinal (where the rock folds downwards) and anticlinal (where the rock folds upwards). Unconformities are where there is a gap in the rock record, typically where rock has been eroded away in the past and a new rock deposited on top.</SPAN></SPAN></P><P STYLE=\"margin:0 0 14 0;\"><SPAN><SPAN>Geologists map and record information on the structural geology.

Dip and strike describe the behaviour of the rock bedding plane. To describe a geometric plane two values are required; the angle from horizontal that it is dipping and the direction that it is dipping. Geologists describe the dip direction by the strike value; this is the azimuth perpendicular to the steepest dip of the plane.</SPAN></P><P STYLE=\"margin:0 0 14 0;\"><SPAN><SPAN>The measurements that this layer contains give information about the geometry of the rock units under the ground.

Before this, public water supplies were managed by Local Authorities. More than 70% of public supplies take groundwater from boreholes, springs and infiltration galleries. This accounts for about 23% by volume (Irish Water, 2018).</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Source Protection Areas (SPAs) </span></span><span><span>are areas outlined around groundwater </span></span><span><span>abstraction points</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>(e.g. borehole or spring)</span></span><span><span> which provide drinking water. </span></span><span><span>The </span></span><span><span>aim</span></span><span><span> of the SPAs is to </span></span><span><span>protect groundwater</span></span><span><span> by placing tighter controls on activities within all or part of the zone of contribution (ZOC) of the source. The Zone of Contribution (ZOC) is the land area that contributes water to the well or spring.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Two Source Protection Areas (SPAs) are outlined. The Inner Protection Area (SI) aims to protect against the effects of human activities that might have an immediate effect on the source and, in particular, against microbial pollution. The Outer Protection Area (SO) covers the rest of the zone of contribution (ZOC) to the groundwater abstraction point.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Not all groundwater-fed public supply sources have SPAs outlined around them.

This accounts for about 23% by volume (Irish Water, 2018).</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Source Protection Areas (SPAs) </span></span><span><span>are areas outlined around groundwater </span></span><span><span>abstraction points</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>(e.g. borehole or spring)</span></span><span><span> which provide drinking water. </span></span><span><span>The </span></span><span><span>aim</span></span><span><span> of the SPAs is to </span></span><span><span>protect groundwater</span></span><span><span> by placing tighter controls on activities within all or part of the zone of contribution (ZOC) of the source. The Zone of Contribution (ZOC) is the land area that contributes water to the well or spring.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Two Source Protection Areas (SPAs) are outlined. The Inner Protection Area (SI) aims to protect against the effects of human activities that might have an immediate effect on the source and, in particular, against microbial pollution. The Outer Protection Area (SO) covers the rest of the zone of contribution (ZOC) to the groundwater abstraction point.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Not all groundwater-fed public supply sources have SPAs outlined around them. Most studies (more than 125) have been carried out by the Geological Survey Ireland as part of County Groundwater Protection Schemes. The Environmental Protection Agency carried out more than 40 studies as part of the national groundwater monitoring network characterisation. Further studies have been carried out by consultancies for Local Authorities and Irish Water.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Different methods are used to map the entire Zone of Contribution to a spring, borehole or well, resulting in different degrees of confidence associated with the boundaries of the delineated area. To be able to specify the Inner Protection Zone within the entire Zone of Contribution, knowledge or estimates of groundwater travel time within the aquifer are needed (e.g. from site-specific hydrogeological parameters or tracer tests).</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Source Protection Areas have been mapped by the GSI and EPA following the ‘GSI method’ (e.g., GSI/EPA/IGI Source Protection Zonation course, 2009; Kelly, 2010; DELG/EPA/GSI, 1999). These SPAs were mapped as part of County Groundwater Protection Schemes or as part of the WFD Groundwater Monitoring network characterisation. Other SPAs have been mapped by consultants for Local Authorities/Irish Water. They have not been peer-reviewed by the GSI. </span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>The Zone of Contribution and the Source Protection Area account for the ‘horizontal’ movement of groundwater. Source Protection Zones are obtained by integrating the Source Protection Areas with the groundwater vulnerability categories. The Source Protection Zone includes the complete pathway, both vertical and horizontal, for re-charge and any entrained contaminants to the abstraction point.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Whereas the aim of delineating ZOCs is to define approximate areas that contribute water to an abstraction point, the aim of SPZs is to geo-scientifically characterise the pathway and receptor elements of risk to groundwater within the ZOC of a given source (Kelly, 2010). EPA prepared an advice note on “Source Protection and Catchment Management to protect Groundwater Supplies” that outlines the key measures and policies in place in Ireland (EPA, 2011).</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>This map shows the location of SPA's which have been mapped around public supplies of groundwater in Ireland. </span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>This map is to the scale 1:20,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 200m.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>It is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (areas).</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>The data is shown as polygons. Each polygon holds information on </span></span><span><span>Source Protection Area </span></span><span><span>such as name, code, id, data source, county, reviewed by GSI and links to online reports</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Group Water Schemes (GWSs) are community-run water supply schemes. About 70% of GWSs take their water from a privately-sourced supply. The rest take their water from an Irish Water connection (DHPLG, 2017). 81% of the privately-sourced supplies affiliated to the National Federation of Group Water Schemes (NFGWS) take groundwater from boreholes, springs and dug wells. This is around 54% by volume (NFGWS, 2018).</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>The NFGWS is the representative for community-owned rural water services in Ireland. The NFGWS assists schemes in meeting the challenges of water quality legislation and promotes a ‘multi-barrier approach’ to source protection. The ‘multi-barrier approach’ includes delineation of the Zone of Contribution to a supply source. </span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span>A Zone of Contribution (ZOC) is the land area that contributes water to a well or spring (Misstear et al., 2006). It can be considered as the ‘catchment’ to the supply source. Like surface water bodies, springs have natural catchment areas, whereas catchment areas to boreholes depend on a number of hydrogeological and meteorological factors plus the abstraction rate. A ZOC accounts for the ‘horizontal’ movement of groundwater and any entrained contamination once it has reached the water table and is moving towards the abstraction point. </span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>The aim of delineating ZOCs is to define the area that contributes water to an abstraction point. Knowledge of where the water is coming from is critical when trying to interpret water quality data at the groundwater source. The ZOC also provides an area in which to focus further investigation and is an area where protective measures can be introduced to maintain or improve the quality of groundwater.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>Different methods can be used to map the ZOC to a spring, borehole or dug well, resulting in different degrees of confidence associated with the boundaries of the de-lineated area. The ZOCs and accompanying reports should be considered as preliminary source protection studies. The work was undertaken by consultants under supervision and review by GSI, and represents a partnership between the GWSs, the NFGWS and GSI. The work was funded through the Rural Water Programme funding initiative of grants towards specific source protection works on GWSs (DECLG Circular L5/13 and Explanatory Memorandum).</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>The ZOCs were delineated in the period 2011 to 2019. The maps produced are based largely on the readily available information in the area, a field walkover survey, and on mapping techniques which use inferences and judgements based on experience at other sites. As such, the maps cannot claim to be definitively accurate across the whole area covered and should not be used as the sole basis for site-specific decisions, which will usually require the collection of additional site-specific data.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>This map shows the location of </span></span><span><span>ZOCs</span></span><span><span> which have been mapped around </span></span><span><span>GWS</span></span><span><span> supplies of groundwater in Ireland. </span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 11 0;'><span><span>This map is to the scale 1:20,000.

			"description": "<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p style='margin:0 0 14 0;'><span><span>Karst is a type of landscape where the bedrock has dissolved and created features such as caves, enclosed depressions (sinkholes), disappearing streams, springs and turloughs (seasonal lakes).  Limestone is the most common type of soluble rock. As rain falls it picks up carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air. When this rain reaches the ground and passes through the soil it picks up more CO2 and forms a weak acid solution. The acidified rain water trickles down through cracks and holes in the limestone and over time dissolves the rock. After traveling underground, sometimes for long distances, this water is then discharged at springs, many of which are cave entrances.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 14 0;'><span><span>There are many kinds of karst landforms, ranging in size from millimetres to kilometres. Dolines or sinkholes are small to medium sized enclosed depressions. Uvalas and poljes are large enclosed depressions. A swallow hole is the point where surface stream sinks underground. Turloughs are seasonal lakes. Springs occur where groundwater comes out at the surface, karst springs are usually much bigger than non-karst springs. Estevelles can act as springs or swallow holes. Dry valleys are similar to normal river valleys except they do not have a stream flowing at the bottom. A cave is a natural underground opening in rock large enough for a person to enter. Superficial Solution Features can be seen on rocks dissolved by rain and include pits, grooves, channels, clints (blocks) and grikes (joints). Please read the lineage for further details.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 14 0;'><span><span>This map shows the currently mapped karst landforms in Ireland.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 14 0;'><span><span>Geologists map and record information in the field.

Over much of Ireland, the bedrock is covered by materials such as sands and gravel.  The sands and gravels occur naturally on top of the bedrock. They were laid down by meltwater from melting ice sheets, by rivers, or by wind. </SPAN></SPAN></P><P STYLE=\"margin:0 0 14 0;\"><SPAN><SPAN>There are two main types of bedrock aquifer. In most of them, groundwater flows through fractures and fissures. In about half of the limestone rocks, groundwater flows through cavities and caves. This type of limestone is called karst. </SPAN></SPAN></P><P STYLE=\"margin:0 0 14 0;\"><SPAN><SPAN>Not all sand and gravel layers are aquifers. This is because some of them are very thin or are dry.

Created not to cross some natural features. Defined area with a minimum number of GeoDirectory building address points. Defined area initially created with minimum of 65 – approx. average of around 90 residential address points. Generated using two bespoke algorithms which incorporated the ED and Townland boundaries, ortho-photography, large scale vector data and GeoDirectory data. Before the 2011 census they were split in relation to motorways and dual carriageways. After the census some boundaries were merged and other divided to maintain privacy of the residential area occupants. They are available as generalised and non generalised boundary sets.",

Attributes include a breakdown of population by occupation and sex (e.g. sales and customer service occupations - males, professional occupations - females, managers, directors and senior officials - total). Census 2016 theme 13 represents Occupation. The Census is carried out every five years by the CSO to determine an account of every person in Ireland. The results provide information on a range of themes, such as, population, housing and education. The data were sourced from the CSO.There are 3,440 Electoral Divisions (EDs) which are the smallest legally defined administrative areas in the State. One ED, St. Mary's, straddles the Louth-Meath county border, and is presented in two parts in the SAPS tables, with one part in Louth and the other in Meath. There are 32 EDs with low population, which for reasons of confidentiality have been amalgamated into neighbouring EDs giving a total of 3,409 EDs which appear in the SAPS tables. The graphic file contains the boundaries for 3,409 EDs.",

Using the road network from the Tailte Éireann National Map and the ArcGIS Network Analyst tool the shortest distance path was calculated for each dwelling enumerated in the 2016 census to the nearest public transport stop. The resulting output was merged with the main Census of Population 2016 dataset to identify all persons who resided within 500 metres proximity of their nearest public transport stop and to get the relevant breakdowns of the population.Only population within large settlements (e.g. 20,000 or more) were in scope as the metadata for 11.2.1 makes reference to persons having access to public transport facilities with frequent services. The data published for this indicator is based upon the assumption that large settlements would have a greater likelihood of pubic transport services operating on a regular basis during peak times each day.",

			"description": "This feature layer represents Sustainable Development Goal indicator 1.2.2 'Proportion of Men, Women and Children of All Ages Living in Poverty in All its Dimensions' for Ireland, 2018. The layer was created using deprivation rate data from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann. The dataset includes deprivation rates from 2004 through to 2018.The NUTS3 boundaries were amended on the 21st of November 2016 (Regulation (EC) No 2066/2016). Data for years 2004-2011, inclusive, refer to the former Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation (EU) 1059/2003) (more info). Data for years 2012-2018 refer to the current NUTS3 boundaries. The changes resulting from the amendment are that Louth has moved from the Border to the Mid-East and what was formerly South Tipperary has moved from the South-East to the Mid-West. An overall value for State is also included within this feature service, however to symbolise by NUTS3 region this value has been filtered out of the map view. The filter can be removed by clicking on the filter icon  in the map viewer. In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda.

Attributes include the number of homeless persons in a particular week of the month stated, from January 2019 to January 2020. Official homelessness data is produced by local authorities thrugh the Pathway Accommodation &amp; Support System (PASS). PASS was rolled-out nationally during the course of 2013. The data produced captures details of individuals in State-funded emergency accommodation, arrangements that are overseen by local authorities. The lead local authorities for homelessness in each region provide monthly reports on homelessness which identify the number of people utilising State-funded emergency accommodation on a regional and county basis. These reports are available from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 1 which aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.",

The layer was created using data from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann. The data set includes percentage growth rates of household expenditure or income per capita from 2007 to 2016. Please note SILC data calculations have been performed using Equivalised Net Disposable income which is the closest measure to disposable income per capita available. An Equivalised income is a weighted income based on the household composition. The weight is created by giving the First Adult is the Household a weight of 1, any Second and Subsequent adults a weight of 0.66 and any child a weight of 0.33 e.g. Annual Total household income is €30,000 in a household with 2 adults and 1 child (Weight = 1.99). Annual Equivalised total income = €30,000/1.99 = €15,075.Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the\nformer Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation\n(EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission\nRegulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info).\n\nIn 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda.

The layer has been developed as a proxy to represent SDG 15.1.2 'Proportion of important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity that are covered by protected areas, by ecosystem type' for Ireland. The layer was created using protected areas data produced by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (i.e. Special Areas of Conservation, Special Protection Areas, Natural Heritage Sites), more info, and Administrative County boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann.In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 15 which aims to protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.",

Attributes include Relative and Absolute HP Deprivation Index Scores for 2006, 2011 and 2016 as well as variables used to derive the scores. Relative HP Deprivation Index Scores are classified as follows; over 30 - extremely affluent, 20 to 30 - very affluent, 10 to 20 - affluent, 0 to 10 marginally above average, 0 to -10 - marginally below average, -10 to -20 - disadvantaged, -20 to -30 - very disadvantaged, below -30 - extremely disadvantaged, more info.The layer was created using the Pobal HP Deprivation Index produced by Trutz Haase and pre 2014 Administrative County boundary data (more info) produced by Tailte Éireann.In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 1 which aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.",

Attributes include mortality rate by neonatal period, early (0-6 days) or late (7-27 days). The layer was created using data produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) as part of the CSO's Vital Statistics Annual Report 2015 and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann.Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the\nformer Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation\n(EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission\nRegulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info).\n\nIn 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 3 which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.",

The RMP was issued for each county between 1995 and 1998 in a similar format to the existing SMR.

The RMP was issued for each county between 1995 and 1998 in a similar format to the existing SMR.

The SMR is a manual containing a numbered list of certain and possible monuments accompanied by 6-inch Ordnance Survey maps (at a reduced scale). The SMR formed the basis for issuing the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) - the statutory list of recorded monuments established under Section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994. The RMP was issued for each county between 1995 and 1998 in a similar format to the existing SMR. The RMP differs from the earlier lists in that, as defined in the Act, only monuments with known locations or places where there are believed to be monuments are included.</span></p><p style='margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0.0001pt; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'><span style='font-family:&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:9pt; color:rgb(26, 26, 27);'> </span></p><p style='margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0.0001pt; font-family:&quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:16px;'><span style='font-family:&quot;Segoe UI&quot;, sans-serif; font-size:9pt; color:rgb(26, 26, 27);'>The large Archaeological Survey of Ireland archive and supporting database are managed by the National Monuments Service and the records are continually updated and supplemented as additional monuments are discovered. On the Historic Environment viewer an area around each monument has been shaded, the scale of which varies with the class of monument. This area does not define the extent of the monument, nor does it define a buffer area beyond which ground disturbance should not take place – it merely identifies an area of land within which it is expected that the monument will be located. It is not a constraint area for screening – such must be set by the relevant authority who requires screening for their own purposes.

This resulted in a common repository of\ngeometry of which the different datasets were derived. The different scale levels were derived\nof generalisations of the common repository on 100K scale. This means that within each\nscale level the feature classes of all these datasets: COMM_2020, NUTS_2021, CNTR_2020,\nEEZ_2020 and COAS_2020, are fully coherent and compliant. Each scale level in the\nCNTR_2020 dataset consists of 2 feature classes (regions and boundaries) The boundaries\nand regions are related to each other through a relationship table. In addition to the region and\nboundary feature classes there is also 1 label feature class which is scale independent. For\neach CNTR in the region feature class there is exactly 1 label and an associated record in the\nCNTR_AT table which contains names and poltical status.<br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:open_sansregular, open_sansregular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:13px;'>Please be aware that there are specific </span><a href='https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units' rel='nofollow ugc' style='box-sizing:border-box; color:rgb(40, 115, 230); text-decoration-line:none; font-size:13px; font-family:open_sansregular, Arial, sans-serif;' target='_blank'>download provisions</a><span style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:open_sansregular, open_sansregular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:13px;'> for the datasets in this item which must be respected.  The download and usage of these data is subject to their acceptance.</span><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Data Source:</div><div><a href='https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units</a><br /></div><div><a href='https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/countries#countries20' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/countries#countries20</a><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><span style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:open_sansregular, open_sansregular, Arial, sans-serif; font-size:13px;'> © EuroGeographics</span><br /></div><div><br /></div>",

Residential phasing is the phased release of land for residential development. The purpose of phasing is to ensure that the physical and social infrastructure required is provided in tandem with the residential development. The phasing programme will indicate the number of phases proposed and the enabling works that are required in each phase before being able to move onto the next phase. The programme will also specify the amount of residential development that should take place in each phase, integrated with the provision of the appropriate social facilities (such as schools, childcare and health facilities), transport access etc</span>",

These channels are either modified watercourses or constructed channels/drains to enhance the conveyance or constructed to modify the flow regime in an area. The average channel is requiring maintenance every four to six years. However, this varies with some channels requiring maintenance annually and others only requiring maintenance every twenty years. Circa 2,000 km of channels are maintained annually and nearly all of the 11,500 km of channels will have been maintained at least once over the Programme cycle of six years. Arterial Drainage Schemes were carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 to improve land for agricultural purposes. The Act was amended on a number of occasions, for example to transpose EU Regulations and Directives such as the EIA, SEA, and Habitats Directives and the Aarhus Convention. The Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995 further allows for the implementation of localised flood relief schemes to provide flood protection for cities, towns and villages. Statutory Arterial Drainage Maintenance entails the maintenance of completed Arterial Drainage Schemes and completed Flood Relief Schemes. The OPW are responsible for the maintenance of 11,500km of channel, 800km of embankments, some 19,000 bridges and further ancillary structures such as weirs, sluice barrages, sluices, pumping stations and tidal flap gates.</p><p style='box-sizing:border-box; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'>Purpose: This data has been developed to support the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 &amp; 1995, that OPW has a statutory obligation to maintain.
