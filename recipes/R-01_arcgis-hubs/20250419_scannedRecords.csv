Groundwater Flood Probability Maps [GSI] [Ireland GeoHive],Geological Survey Ireland,Groundwater Flood Probability Maps [GSI],"Groundwater is the water that soaks into the ground from rain and can be stored beneath the ground. Groundwater floods occur when the water stored beneath the ground rises above the land surface. The Historic Groundwater Flood Map shows the observed peak flood extents caused by groundwater in Ireland. This map was made using satellite images (Copernicus Programme Sentinel-1), field data, aerial photos, as well as flood records from the past. Most of the data was collected during the flood events of winter 2015 / 2016, as in most areas this data showed the largest floods on record.This map is to the scale 1:20,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 200m.The map is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (area). The floods are shown as polygons. Each polygon has info about the type of flood, the data source, and the area of the flood.The flood extents were calculated using data and techniques with various precision levels, and as such, it may not show the true historic peak flood extents.The Winter 2015/2016 Surface Water Flooding map shows fluvial (rivers) and pluvial (rain) floods, excluding urban areas, during the winter 2015/2016 flood event, and was developed as a by-product of the historic groundwater flood map.This map is to the scale 1:20,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 200m.The map is a vector dataset. The floods are shown as polygons. Each polygon has info about the type of flood, the data source, and the area of the flood.The flood extents were made using remote sensing images (Copernicus Programme Sentinel-1), which covered any site in Ireland every 4-6 days. As such, it may not show the true peak flood extents.The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Seasonal Flood Maps shows observed peak flood extents which took place between Autumn 2015 and Summer 2021. The maps were made using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Copernicus Programme Sentinel-1 satellites. SAR systems emit radar pulses and record the return signal at the satellite. Flat surfaces such as water return a low signal. Based on this low signal, SAR imagery can be classified into non-flooded and flooded (i.e. flat) pixels.Flood extents were created using Python 2.7 algorithms developed by Geological Survey Ireland. They were refined using a series of post processing filters. Please read the lineage for more information.The flood maps shows flood extents which have been observed to occur. A lack of flooding in any part of the map only implies that a flood was not observed. It does not imply that a flood cannot occur in that location at present or in the future.This flood extent are to the scale 1:20,000. This means they should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the maps relates to a distance of 200m.They are vector datasets. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (areas). The flood extents are shown as polygons. Each polygon has information on the confidence of the flood extent (high, medium or low), a flood id and a unique id.The Groundwater Flooding High Probability map shows the expected flood extent of groundwater flooding in limestone regions for annual exceedance probabilities (AEP's) of 10%, which correspond with a return period of every 10 years.

SAR Seasonal Flood Maps [GSI] [Ireland GeoHive],Geological Survey Ireland,SAR Seasonal Flood Maps [GSI],"Groundwater is the water that soaks into the ground from rain and can be stored beneath the ground. Groundwater floods occur when the water stored beneath the ground rises above the land surface. The Historic Groundwater Flood Map shows the observed peak flood extents caused by groundwater in Ireland. This map was made using satellite images (Copernicus Programme Sentinel-1), field data, aerial photos, as well as flood records from the past. Most of the data was collected during the flood events of winter 2015 / 2016, as in most areas this data showed the largest floods on record.This map is to the scale 1:20,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 200m.The map is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (area). The floods are shown as polygons. Each polygon has info about the type of flood, the data source, and the area of the flood.The flood extents were calculated using data and techniques with various precision levels, and as such, it may not show the true historic peak flood extents.The Winter 2015/2016 Surface Water Flooding map shows fluvial (rivers) and pluvial (rain) floods, excluding urban areas, during the winter 2015/2016 flood event, and was developed as a by-product of the historic groundwater flood map.This map is to the scale 1:20,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 200m.The map is a vector dataset. The floods are shown as polygons.

As such, it may not show the true peak flood extents.The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Seasonal Flood Maps shows observed peak flood extents which took place between Autumn 2015 and Summer 2021. The maps were made using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Copernicus Programme Sentinel-1 satellites. SAR systems emit radar pulses and record the return signal at the satellite. Flat surfaces such as water return a low signal. Based on this low signal, SAR imagery can be classified into non-flooded and flooded (i.e. flat) pixels.Flood extents were created using Python 2.7 algorithms developed by Geological Survey Ireland. They were refined using a series of post processing filters. Please read the lineage for more information.The flood maps shows flood extents which have been observed to occur. A lack of flooding in any part of the map only implies that a flood was not observed. It does not imply that a flood cannot occur in that location at present or in the future.This flood extent are to the scale 1:20,000. This means they should be viewed at that scale.

Planning Exemptions - Settlements [Ireland GeoHive],geohive_curator,Planning Exemptions - Settlements,"The dataset represents planning exemption notifications received by local authorities in the five year period 2018 - 2022 at settlement level. The dataset includes information on settlements that have received more than 5 notifications or planned changes of use that would provide for more than 10 new homes.Settlement boundaries: Settlements Ungeneralised - National Statistical Boundaries - 2015In order to distinguish between the urban and rural population for census analysis, the boundaries of distinct settlements need to be defined. This requires the creation of suburbs and extensions to existing cities and legal towns, as well as delineating boundaries for settlements which are not legally defined (called Census towns). From 1971 to 2006, Census towns were defined as a cluster of fifty or more occupied dwellings where, within a radius of 800 metres there was a nucleus of thirty occupied dwellings (on both sides of a road, or twenty on one side of a road), along with a clearly defined urban centre e.g. a shop, a school, a place of worship or a community centre. Census town boundaries where extended over time where there was an occupied dwelling within 200 metres of the existing boundary. To avoid the agglomeration of adjacent towns caused by the inclusion of low density one off dwellings on the approach routes to towns, the 2011 criteria were tightened, in line with UN criteria. In Census 2011 a new Census town was defined as being a cluster with a minimum of 50 occupied dwellings, with a maximum distance between any dwelling and the building closest to it of 100 metres, and where there was evidence of an urban centre (shop, school etc). The proximity criteria for extending existing 2006 Census town boundaries was also amended to include all occupied dwellings within 100 metres of an existing building. Other information based on Tailte Éireann mapping and orthogonal photography was taken into account when extending boundaries. Boundary extensions were generally made to include the land parcel on which a dwelling was built or using other physical features such as roads, paths etc. Extensions to the environs and suburbs of legal towns and cities were also constructed using the 100 metre proximity rule applied to Census towns. For census reports, urban settlements are towns with a population of 1,500 or more, while settlements with a population of less than 1,500 are classified as rural.",eng,"This dataset was automatically cataloged from the provider's ArcGIS Hub.

Using the road network from the Tailte Éireann National Map and the ArcGIS Network Analyst tool the shortest distance path was calculated for each dwelling enumerated in the 2016 census to the nearest public transport stop.

This layer was created using Irish Health Survey 2015 data produced by Central Statistics Office (CSO) and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann. Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the former Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation (EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info). In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data.

Updates of the historic time series resumed on 25th February 2022 (for cases created up to midnight on 21st February). As work is still ongoing to geo-code all cases created during the surge period, there is a gap in the historic LEA time series for cases created between 21st December 2021 and 21st January 2022.

In total, there are 166 LEA's across Ireland.Please note: For confidentiality reasons, following consultation with the CSO, all LEA's with values below 5 have been suppressed to 'Less than 5'. Where a rate per 100k is set to 'Less than 5' it means that the LEA has a 14 Day incidence below 5 and its value has been suppressed to show 'Less than 5'. This is not an indication of zero (0) confirmed cases.For a proportion of notified COVID-19 cases, their location on the map may reflect their place of work rather than their home address.

The layer has been added as a proxy to represent SDG 14.1.1 'Index of Coastal Eutrophication and Floating Plastic Debris Density' for Ireland. In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland's performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 14 which aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.",eng,"This dataset was automatically cataloged from the provider's ArcGIS Hub.

The RMP was issued for each county between 1995 and 1998 in a similar format to the existing SMR.

The RMP was issued for each county between 1995 and 1998 in a similar format to the existing SMR. The RMP differs from the earlier lists in that, as defined in the Act, only monuments with known locations or places where there are believed to be monuments are included.The large Archaeological Survey of Ireland archive and supporting database are managed by the National Monuments Service and the records are continually updated and supplemented as additional monuments are discovered. On the Historic Environment viewer an area around each monument has been shaded, the scale of which varies with the class of monument. This area does not define the extent of the monument, nor does it define a buffer area beyond which ground disturbance should not take place - it merely identifies an area of land within which it is expected that the monument will be located. It is not a constraint area for screening - such must be set by the relevant authority who requires screening for their own purposes. This data has been released for download as Open Data under the DPER Open Data Strategy and is licensed for re-use under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International licence.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Please note that the centre point of each record is not indicative of the geographic extent of the monument. The existing point centroids were digitised relative to the OSI 6-inch mapping and the move from this older IG-referenced series to the larger-scale ITM mapping will necessitate revisions. The accuracy of the derived ITM co-ordinates is limited to the OS 6-inch scale and errors may ensue should the user apply the co-ordinates to larger scale maps. Records that do not refer to 'monuments' are designated 'Redundant record' and are retained in the archive as they may relate to features that were once considered to be monuments but which on investigation proved otherwise. Redundant records may also refer to duplicate records or errors in the data structure of the Archaeological Survey of Ireland.This dataset is provided for re-use in a number of ways and the technical options are outlined below. For a live and current view of the data, please use the web services or the data extract tool in the Historic Environment Viewer. The National Monuments Service also provide an Open Data snapshot of its national dataset in CSV as a bulk data download.

Over much of Ireland, the bedrock is covered by materials such as soil and gravel. The Bedrock map shows what the land surface of Ireland would be made up of if these materials were removed. As the bedrock is commonly covered, bedrock maps are an interpretation of the available data. Geologists map and record information on the composition and structure of rock outcrops (rock which can be seen on the land surface) and boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground). Areas are drawn on a map to show the distribution of rocks. The Geological Lines layer shows the details of the structural geology; faults, folds and unconformities. Faults and folds are the result of great pressure being applied to rock across a whole continent or more. These rocks will either break under the pressure, forming faults, or they will bend to form folds. Faults are recorded in the Geological Lines layer as lines where the break in the rock meets the surface. Folds are shown only using the lines of their axes, synclinal (where the rock folds downwards) and anticlinal (where the rock folds upwards). Unconformities are where there is a gap in the rock record, typically where rock has been eroded away in the past and a new rock deposited on top.Geologists map and record information on the structural geology. Lines are drawn on a map to show the location and extent of these structures. The structural symbols layer is used to describe the geology of an area through dip and strike information. Dip and strike describe the behaviour of the rock bedding plane. To describe a geometric plane two values are required; the angle from horizontal that it is dipping and the direction that it is dipping. Geologists describe the dip direction by the strike value; this is the azimuth perpendicular to the steepest dip of the plane.The measurements that this layer contains give information about the geometry of the rock units under the ground. These measurements are the only way to see if the rocks are folded and faulted and how. With this information we can also start to see why the rocks have the shapes that they do.To produce this dataset, the twenty one 1:100,000 paper maps covering Ireland were digitised and borders and overlaps between map sheets were removed. We collect new data to update our map and also use data made available from other sources. This map is to the scale 1:100,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 1km.It is a vector dataset.

IE GSI Bedrock Geology 100K IE26 ITM [Ireland GeoHive],Geological Survey Ireland,IE GSI Bedrock Geology 100K IE26 ITM,"Bedrock is the solid rock at or below the land surface. Over much of Ireland, the bedrock is covered by materials such as soil and gravel. The Bedrock map shows what the land surface of Ireland would be made up of if these materials were removed. As the bedrock is commonly covered, bedrock maps are an interpretation of the available data. Geologists map and record information on the composition and structure of rock outcrops (rock which can be seen on the land surface) and boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground). Areas are drawn on a map to show the distribution of rocks. The Geological Lines layer shows the details of the structural geology; faults, folds and unconformities. Faults and folds are the result of great pressure being applied to rock across a whole continent or more. These rocks will either break under the pressure, forming faults, or they will bend to form folds. Faults are recorded in the Geological Lines layer as lines where the break in the rock meets the surface. Folds are shown only using the lines of their axes, synclinal (where the rock folds downwards) and anticlinal (where the rock folds upwards). Unconformities are where there is a gap in the rock record, typically where rock has been eroded away in the past and a new rock deposited on top.Geologists map and record information on the structural geology. Lines are drawn on a map to show the location and extent of these structures. The structural symbols layer is used to describe the geology of an area through dip and strike information. Dip and strike describe the behaviour of the rock bedding plane. To describe a geometric plane two values are required; the angle from horizontal that it is dipping and the direction that it is dipping. Geologists describe the dip direction by the strike value; this is the azimuth perpendicular to the steepest dip of the plane.The measurements that this layer contains give information about the geometry of the rock units under the ground. These measurements are the only way to see if the rocks are folded and faulted and how.

A lot of this time period relates to the Ice Age. Quaternary geomorphology is the record of landscape features that were created in the last 2.6 million years. In Ireland, movement of glaciers and ice sheets created many of these features. The main features included are; erratic dispersion; landforms created under ice; landforms created at the ice margin and landforms created by mountain ice.An erratic is a rock which has been moved by ice and deposited in another location. Erratics are identified as the erractic rock type is different to the usual rocks found in that location. Geologists study the composition of erratics and can determine where the rock came from (the source). Once the source is known, the direction of ice flow can be determined (Inferred Erratic Path). The end of these erratic flow paths are termed erratic limits.Subglacial landforms are created beneath the ice. They were created during ice expansion. An example of these are drumlins. Drumlins are smooth, oval-shaped hills, shaped like a half-buried egg. They are made up of glacial till. As the glaciers retreated, they left these deposits behind. The exact process of drumlin formation is unknown. Mega-scale glacial lineations, like drumlins, are typically smooth hills of subglacially-deposited material, but are much longer. They are produced beneath zones of fast-flowing ice. Striae (Glacial striations) are scratches or gashes cut into bedrock by glacial movement, usually by particles embedded in glacier ice. They provide a reliable record of ice flow direction. Deglacial landforms are created at the ice margin. They were created during ice retreat. A moraine is material left behind by a moving glacier. Kame terraces, deltas and fans are all ice marginal landforms deposited by water issuing from a glacier.Landforms created by mountain ice include corries and trimlines. A corrie (cirque) is a half open, steep-sided round hollow made in the side of a mountain by the action of a glacier. A trimline is a clear line on the side of a valley formed by a glacier. The line marks the most recent highest extent of the glacier. The line may be visible due to changes in color to the rock or to changes in vegetation on either side of the line.Geologists map and record evidence during field visits, from air photographs and from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs).

A lot of this time period relates to the Ice Age. Quaternary geomorphology is the record of landscape features that were created in the last 2.6 million years. In Ireland, movement of glaciers and ice sheets created many of these features. The main features included are; erratic dispersion; landforms created under ice; landforms created at the ice margin and landforms created by mountain ice.An erratic is a rock which has been moved by ice and deposited in another location. Erratics are identified as the erractic rock type is different to the usual rocks found in that location. Geologists study the composition of erratics and can determine where the rock came from (the source). Once the source is known, the direction of ice flow can be determined (Inferred Erratic Path). The end of these erratic flow paths are termed erratic limits.Subglacial landforms are created beneath the ice. They were created during ice expansion. An example of these are drumlins. Drumlins are smooth, oval-shaped hills, shaped like a half-buried egg. They are made up of glacial till. As the glaciers retreated, they left these deposits behind. The exact process of drumlin formation is unknown. Mega-scale glacial lineations, like drumlins, are typically smooth hills of subglacially-deposited material, but are much longer. They are produced beneath zones of fast-flowing ice. Striae (Glacial striations) are scratches or gashes cut into bedrock by glacial movement, usually by particles embedded in glacier ice. They provide a reliable record of ice flow direction. Deglacial landforms are created at the ice margin. They were created during ice retreat. A moraine is material left behind by a moving glacier. Kame terraces, deltas and fans are all ice marginal landforms deposited by water issuing from a glacier.Landforms created by mountain ice include corries and trimlines. A corrie (cirque) is a half open, steep-sided round hollow made in the side of a mountain by the action of a glacier. A trimline is a clear line on the side of a valley formed by a glacier. The line marks the most recent highest extent of the glacier. The line may be visible due to changes in color to the rock or to changes in vegetation on either side of the line.Geologists map and record evidence during field visits, from air photographs and from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). This data along with boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground) and geophysics help to create the map.

IE GSI Public Water Supply Source Protection Areas 20K IE26 ITM [Ireland GeoHive],Geological Survey Ireland,IE GSI Public Water Supply Source Protection Areas 20K IE26 ITM,"Public Water Supplies (PWSs) are managed by Irish Water, Ireland's national water utility, since 2013. Before this, public water supplies were managed by Local Authorities. More than 70% of public supplies take groundwater from boreholes, springs and infiltration galleries. This accounts for about 23% by volume (Irish Water, 2018).Source Protection Areas (SPAs) are areas outlined around groundwater abstraction points (e.g. borehole or spring) which provide drinking water. The aim of the SPAs is to protect groundwater by placing tighter controls on activities within all or part of the zone of contribution (ZOC) of the source. The Zone of Contribution (ZOC) is the land area that contributes water to the well or spring.Two Source Protection Areas (SPAs) are outlined. The Inner Protection Area (SI) aims to protect against the effects of human activities that might have an immediate effect on the source and, in particular, against microbial pollution. The Outer Protection Area (SO) covers the rest of the zone of contribution (ZOC) to the groundwater abstraction point.Not all groundwater-fed public supply sources have SPAs outlined around them. Most studies (more than 125) have been carried out by the Geological Survey Ireland as part of County Groundwater Protection Schemes. The Environmental Protection Agency carried out more than 40 studies as part of the national groundwater monitoring network characterisation. Further studies have been carried out by consultancies for Local Authorities and Irish Water.Different methods are used to map the entire Zone of Contribution to a spring, borehole or well, resulting in different degrees of confidence associated with the boundaries of the delineated area. To be able to specify the Inner Protection Zone within the entire Zone of Contribution, knowledge or estimates of groundwater travel time within the aquifer are needed (e.g. from site-specific hydrogeological parameters or tracer tests).Source Protection Areas have been mapped by the GSI and EPA following the ‘GSI method' (e.g., GSI/EPA/IGI Source Protection Zonation course, 2009; Kelly, 2010; DELG/EPA/GSI, 1999). These SPAs were mapped as part of County Groundwater Protection Schemes or as part of the WFD Groundwater Monitoring network characterisation. Other SPAs have been mapped by consultants for Local Authorities/Irish Water. They have not been peer-reviewed by the GSI. The Zone of Contribution and the Source Protection Area account for the ‘horizontal' movement of groundwater. Source Protection Zones are obtained by integrating the Source Protection Areas with the groundwater vulnerability categories. The Source Protection Zone includes the complete pathway, both vertical and horizontal, for re-charge and any entrained contaminants to the abstraction point.Whereas the aim of delineating ZOCs is to define approximate areas that contribute water to an abstraction point, the aim of SPZs is to geo-scientifically characterise the pathway and receptor elements of risk to groundwater within the ZOC of a given source (Kelly, 2010). EPA prepared an advice note on ""Source Protection and Catchment Management to protect Groundwater Supplies"" that outlines the key measures and policies in place in Ireland (EPA, 2011).This map shows the location of SPA's which have been mapped around public supplies of groundwater in Ireland. This map is to the scale 1:20,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 200m.It is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (areas).The data is shown as polygons. Each polygon holds information on Source Protection Area such as name, code, id, data source, county, reviewed by GSI and links to online reportsGroup Water Schemes (GWSs) are community-run water supply schemes. About 70% of GWSs take their water from a privately-sourced supply. The rest take their water from an Irish Water connection (DHPLG, 2017). 81% of the privately-sourced supplies affiliated to the National Federation of Group Water Schemes (NFGWS) take groundwater from boreholes, springs and dug wells. This is around 54% by volume (NFGWS, 2018).The NFGWS is the representative for community-owned rural water services in Ireland. The NFGWS assists schemes in meeting the challenges of water quality legislation and promotes a ‘multi-barrier approach' to source protection. The ‘multi-barrier approach' includes delineation of the Zone of Contribution to a supply source. A Zone of Contribution (ZOC) is the land area that contributes water to a well or spring (Misstear et al., 2006). It can be considered as the ‘catchment' to the supply source. Like surface water bodies, springs have natural catchment areas, whereas catchment areas to boreholes depend on a number of hydrogeological and meteorological factors plus the abstraction rate. A ZOC accounts for the ‘horizontal' movement of groundwater and any entrained contamination once it has reached the water table and is moving towards the abstraction point. The aim of delineating ZOCs is to define the area that contributes water to an abstraction point. Knowledge of where the water is coming from is critical when trying to interpret water quality data at the groundwater source. The ZOC also provides an area in which to focus further investigation and is an area where protective measures can be introduced to maintain or improve the quality of groundwater.Different methods can be used to map the ZOC to a spring, borehole or dug well, resulting in different degrees of confidence associated with the boundaries of the de-lineated area. The ZOCs and accompanying reports should be considered as preliminary source protection studies. The work was undertaken by consultants under supervision and review by GSI, and represents a partnership between the GWSs, the NFGWS and GSI. The work was funded through the Rural Water Programme funding initiative of grants towards specific source protection works on GWSs (DECLG Circular L5/13 and Explanatory Memorandum).The ZOCs were delineated in the period 2011 to 2019. The maps produced are based largely on the readily available information in the area, a field walkover survey, and on mapping techniques which use inferences and judgements based on experience at other sites. As such, the maps cannot claim to be definitively accurate across the whole area covered and should not be used as the sole basis for site-specific decisions, which will usually require the collection of additional site-specific data.This map shows the location of ZOCs which have been mapped around GWS supplies of groundwater in Ireland.

This includes rock, earth, mud and peat. Landslides in Ireland mainly occur on steep mountain slopes. A landslide susceptibility map shows areas where a landslide could occur, how likely it will occur and what causes them. The likelihood is measured from low to high. The map is created using a method called the Unique Condition Unit (UCU). A unique condition unit is an area with a set of ground types. It tells us what the soil type is, what the slope is (angle of the ground) and where water flows. When many landslides occur in a unit, the map will show high landslide susceptibility.

There are many types of sites. They are made from past and present geological processes (wearing away and building up of rocks and soils). They are a window into the past and present changes to the earth.The Geoheritage sites are called ‘county geological sites'(CGS). The geology is divided into 16 themes (groups). The best sites are chosen from each group by theme experts. After this, each site is checked to make sure it is the best example. Geological Survey Ireland (GSI) does this together with the Heritage Council and Local Authorities.The data is collected on a county by county basis with detailed site audits. Before each site is visited all known geological data for the county is checked. Next, each site is visited to record: the key geological features; whether the site can be accessed by the public; if the site is suitable to be promoted for tourism or education; and general condition. The site's key features are recorded, mapped and photographed.The data shown on the map was collected on paper during each site visit. Afterwards the data was digitised.

This can yield up to four times as much energy as is used to collect it, giving ‘four for the price of one' in energy terms. Heat energy can be harnessed, or ‘collected', using different types of collector systems:Closed loop collectors are systems where heat is extracted from the ground (or cooling is gained) by pumping a heat exchange fluid through closed pipes within the ground. The pipes can be installed borehole(s) (vertical closed loop) or laid out horizontally (horizontal closed loop).Open loop ground source heat systems operate by taking heat energy from abstracted groundwater using a heat pump. The volume of groundwater that can be abstracted from a borehole or taken from a spring each day (the ‘yield') determines the total amount of heat energy available, and therefore the size of heat pump that can be used and the size of building that can be heated.The ground source heating/cooling suitability maps indicate which type of ground source heat collector is most compatible with the geology below your site. All maps should be assessed together, since whilst some areas may be unsuitable for one type of ground source heat collector system (‘ground source heat pumps' or GSHPs), the heat energy can be successfully harnessed by a different type of system. The maps show that there is a shallow geothermal solution for heating or cooling for every location in Ireland.The suitability maps use a suitability rating ranging from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) for each type of heat collector/cooling system.

An aquifer is a body of rock and/or sediment that holds groundwater. The process of rain filling up an aquifer is called ‘recharge'. The Groundwater Recharge map shows the amount of rainfall which reaches the stores of groundwater (the ‘aquifers') across Ireland. The amount of recharge was calculated over the period 1981-2010 and then averaged to give a yearly amount.Geological information is interpreted by hydrogeologists to create the map includes soil drainage, subsoil type, subsoil permeability, subsoil thickness, groundwater vulnerability and aquifers. The amount of rain falling on the land minus how much of that rain is taken up by plants is also a factor that determines how much groundwater recharge there is at a particular location. This is known as the ‘effective rainfall'.Different combinations of the geological factors give 24 hydrogeological scenarios. There is a ‘recharge coefficient' for each scenario, which is the percentage of the ‘effective rainfall' that may become groundwater recharge. Using ArcGIS software, the data are merged to create areas on a map to show the recharge. Please read the lineage for more detail.This map is to the scale 1:40,000.

Limestone is the most common type of soluble rock. As rain falls it picks up carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air. When this rain reaches the ground and passes through the soil it picks up more CO2 and forms a weak acid solution. The acidified rain water trickles down through cracks and holes in the limestone and over time dissolves the rock. After traveling underground, sometimes for long distances, this water is then discharged at springs, many of which are cave entrances.There are many kinds of karst landforms, ranging in size from millimetres to kilometres. Dolines or sinkholes are small to medium sized enclosed depressions. Uvalas and poljes are large enclosed depressions. A swallow hole is the point where surface stream sinks underground. Turloughs are seasonal lakes. Springs occur where groundwater comes out at the surface, karst springs are usually much bigger than non-karst springs. Estevelles can act as springs or swallow holes.

IE GSI Sand and Gravel Aquifers 40K IE26 ITM [Ireland GeoHive],Geological Survey Ireland,IE GSI Sand and Gravel Aquifers 40K IE26 ITM,"Groundwater is the water that soaks into the ground from rain and can be stored beneath the ground. An aquifer is a body of rock and/or sediment that holds groundwater. There are two main types of aquifer in Ireland - bedrock aquifers, and sand and gravel aquifers. Bedrock is the solid rock at or below the land surface. Over much of Ireland, the bedrock is covered by materials such as sands and gravel. The sands and gravels occur naturally on top of the bedrock. They were laid down by meltwater from melting ice sheets, by rivers, or by wind. There are two main types of bedrock aquifer. In most of them, groundwater flows through fractures and fissures. In about half of the limestone rocks, groundwater flows through cavities and caves. This type of limestone is called karst. Not all sand and gravel layers are aquifers. This is because some of them are very thin or are dry. If the sands and gravels are saturated with water, they have the potential to supply large volumes of water through wells or springs. The aquifer maps show the potential of areas in Ireland to provide water supplies. There are three main groups based on their resource potential:Regionally important - the aquifers are capable of supporting large public water supplies sufficient to support a large town; Locally important - the aquifers are capable of supporting smaller public water supplies or group schemes; Poor - the aquifers are only capable of supporting small supplies, such as houses or farms, or small group schemes.The three main groups are broken down into nine aquifer categories in total. Please read the lineage for further details.Information used to assign bedrock aquifer categories include: rock type (Hydrostratigraphic Rock Unit Groups - simplified bedrock geology with similar hydrogeological properties), yield (existing wells and springs), permeability and structural characteristics. All of the information is interpreted by a hydrogeologist and areas are drawn on a map to show the aquifers.This Bedrock Aquifer map is to the scale 1:100,000 (1 cm on the map relates to a distance of 1km).It is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (areas).The bedrock aquifer data is shown as polygons.

They also note down how big the different grains of sand and gravel are. Information from quarries and deep pits is used. Information from boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground) is also used. All of the information is interpreted by a hydrogeologist and areas are drawn on a map to show the aquifersThe Sand and Gravel Aquifer map is to the scale 1:40,000 (1 cm on the map relates to a distance of 400 m).It is a vector dataset. The sand and gravel aquifer data is shown as polygons. Each polygon holds information on the aquifer code, description, name, comments and confidence level associated with the delineation of the area as an aquifer.The Aquifer Geological Lines shows the details of the structural geology; faults and thrusts. Faults are the result of great pressure being applied to rock across a whole continent or more. These rocks break under the pressure, forming faults. Faults are recorded as lines where the break in the rock meets the surface. A thrust fault is a break in the Earth's crust, across which older rocks are pushed above younger rocks.Geologists map and record information on the composition and structure of rock outcrops (rock which can be seen on the land surface) and boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground).

IE GSI Aquifer Geological Lines 100K IE26 ITM [Ireland GeoHive],Geological Survey Ireland,IE GSI Aquifer Geological Lines 100K IE26 ITM,"Groundwater is the water that soaks into the ground from rain and can be stored beneath the ground. An aquifer is a body of rock and/or sediment that holds groundwater. There are two main types of aquifer in Ireland - bedrock aquifers, and sand and gravel aquifers. Bedrock is the solid rock at or below the land surface. Over much of Ireland, the bedrock is covered by materials such as sands and gravel. The sands and gravels occur naturally on top of the bedrock. They were laid down by meltwater from melting ice sheets, by rivers, or by wind. There are two main types of bedrock aquifer. In most of them, groundwater flows through fractures and fissures. In about half of the limestone rocks, groundwater flows through cavities and caves. This type of limestone is called karst. Not all sand and gravel layers are aquifers. This is because some of them are very thin or are dry. If the sands and gravels are saturated with water, they have the potential to supply large volumes of water through wells or springs. The aquifer maps show the potential of areas in Ireland to provide water supplies. There are three main groups based on their resource potential:Regionally important - the aquifers are capable of supporting large public water supplies sufficient to support a large town; Locally important - the aquifers are capable of supporting smaller public water supplies or group schemes; Poor - the aquifers are only capable of supporting small supplies, such as houses or farms, or small group schemes.The three main groups are broken down into nine aquifer categories in total. Please read the lineage for further details.Information used to assign bedrock aquifer categories include: rock type (Hydrostratigraphic Rock Unit Groups - simplified bedrock geology with similar hydrogeological properties), yield (existing wells and springs), permeability and structural characteristics. All of the information is interpreted by a hydrogeologist and areas are drawn on a map to show the aquifers.This Bedrock Aquifer map is to the scale 1:100,000 (1 cm on the map relates to a distance of 1km).It is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (areas).The bedrock aquifer data is shown as polygons. Each polygon holds information on the aquifer code, description, rock unit name, rock unit description, Hydrostratigraphic Rock Unit Group Name, Hydrostratigraphic Rock Unit Group Changes, Bedrock Geology 100k newcode, stratigraphy code (rock layers with age profile), lithology code (rock type), Aquifer Category Original and Comments.Geologists record information about how thick the sand and gravel layers on top of the bedrock are. They also note down how big the different grains of sand and gravel are. Information from quarries and deep pits is used. Information from boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground) is also used. All of the information is interpreted by a hydrogeologist and areas are drawn on a map to show the aquifersThe Sand and Gravel Aquifer map is to the scale 1:40,000 (1 cm on the map relates to a distance of 400 m).It is a vector dataset. The sand and gravel aquifer data is shown as polygons. Each polygon holds information on the aquifer code, description, name, comments and confidence level associated with the delineation of the area as an aquifer.The Aquifer Geological Lines shows the details of the structural geology; faults and thrusts. Faults are the result of great pressure being applied to rock across a whole continent or more. These rocks break under the pressure, forming faults. Faults are recorded as lines where the break in the rock meets the surface. A thrust fault is a break in the Earth's crust, across which older rocks are pushed above younger rocks.Geologists map and record information on the composition and structure of rock outcrops (rock which can be seen on the land surface) and boreholes (a deep narrow round hole drilled in the ground). Lines are drawn on a map to show the structure. To produce this dataset, the twenty one 1:100,000 paper maps covering Ireland were digitised and any inconsistencies between map sheets were fixed. We collect new data to update our map and also use data made available from other sources. This map is to the scale 1:100,000 (1cm on the map relates to a distance of 1km).It is a vector dataset.

IE GSI Groundwater Wells and Springs 100K Ireland (ROI) ITM [Ireland GeoHive],Geological Survey Ireland,IE GSI Groundwater Wells and Springs 100K Ireland (ROI) ITM,"A well is a hole dug into the ground usually for the purpose of taking water from the ground but also for monitoring groundwater. Most private wells are used for home and farm water supplies are in rural areas. Springs occur where groundwater comes out at the surface. A borehole is a hole drilled into the ground to gain access to groundwater. The hole is usually deep, narrow and round. This map shows the location of the dug wells, springs and boreholes in Ireland. Data was collected by GSI drilling or submitted to the GSI from Local Authorities and other state bodies, Private Well Grants, Drillers, Consultants, Group Water Schemes and Academia. The location accuracy is visually portrayed on the GSI webmapping viewer by the size of the circle displaying the record. It is NOT a comprehensive database and many wells and springs are not included in this database. You should not rely only on this database, and should undertake your own site study for wells in the area of interest if needed.This map is to the scale 1:100,000. This means it should be viewed at that scale. When printed at that scale 1cm on the map relates to a distance of 1km.It is a vector dataset. Vector data portray the world using points, lines, and polygons (areas).The data is shown as polygons. Each polygon holds information on the location of the borehole (X and Y coordinates), Well ID (well identifier), hole details, location details, yield, abstraction ,drilling details.",eng,"This dataset was automatically cataloged from the provider's ArcGIS Hub.
