This requires the creation of suburbs and extensions to existing cities and legal towns, as well as delineating boundaries for settlements which are not legally defined (called Census towns). From 1971 to 2006, Census towns were defined as a cluster of fifty or more occupied dwellings where, within a radius of 800 metres there was a nucleus of thirty occupied dwellings (on both sides of a road, or twenty on one side of a road), along with a clearly defined urban centre e.g. a shop, a school, a place of worship or a community centre. Census town boundaries where extended over time where there was an occupied dwelling within 200 metres of the existing boundary. To avoid the agglomeration of adjacent towns caused by the inclusion of low density one off dwellings on the approach routes to towns, the 2011 criteria were tightened, in line with UN criteria. In Census 2011 a new Census town was defined as being a cluster with a minimum of 50 occupied dwellings, with a maximum distance between any dwelling and the building closest to it of 100 metres, and where there was evidence of an urban centre (shop, school etc). The proximity criteria for extending existing 2006 Census town boundaries was also amended to include all occupied dwellings within 100 metres of an existing building. Other information based on Tailte Éireann mapping and orthogonal photography was taken into account when extending boundaries. Boundary extensions were generally made to include the land parcel on which a dwelling was built or using other physical features such as roads, paths etc. Extensions to the environs and suburbs of legal towns and cities were also constructed using the 100 metre proximity rule applied to Census towns.

Soil Information System adopted a unique methodology combining digital soil
mapping techniques with traditional soil survey application. Developing earlier
work conducted by An Foras Talúntais, the project generated soil-landscape
models for previously surveyed counties. These soil-landscape (‘soilscape’)
models formed the basis for training statistical ‘inference engines’ for
predicting soil mapping units, checked during field survey. 213 soil series are
identified, each with differing characteristics, having contrasting
environmental and agronomic responses. Properties were recorded in a database
able to satisfy national and EU policy requirements. The Irish soil map and
related soil property data will also serve public interest, providing the means
to learn online about Irish soil resources. Use the Symbology layer file

considered to have a predominant influence on soil processes (Schulte et al.,
2012). The maritime climate of Ireland drives wet soil conditions, such that
excess soil moisture in combination with heavy textured soils is considered a
key constraint in relation to achieving productivity and environmental targets.
Both soil moisture content and the rate at which water drains from the soil are
critical indicators of soil physical quality and the overall functional
capacity of soil. Therefore, a natural extension to the Irish Soil Information
System included the development of an indicative soil drainage map for Ireland.
The soil subgroup map was used to develop the indicative drainage map, based on
diagnostic criteria relating to the subgroup categorization. Use the Symbology
layer file 'SOIL_SISSoilDrainage.lyr' based on Value Field 'Drainage'.</span></span></p><p><span style='font-size:10.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#333333;'><br />

the soil cover and reflects the relationship between parent material and length
of soil forming processes. Soil depth determines the potential rooting depth of
plants and any restrictions within the soil that may hinder rooting depth.
Plants derive nearly 80 per cent of their water needs from the upper part of
the soil solum, i.e. where the root system is denser. The rooting depths depend
on plant physiology, type of soil and water availability. Generally, vegetables
(beans, tomatoes, potatoes, parsnip, carrots, leek, broccoli, etc.) are shallow
rooted, about 50–60 cm; fruit trees and some other plants have medium rooting
depths, 70–120 cm and other crops such as barley, wheat, oats, and maize may
have deeper roots. Furthermore, rooting depths vary according to the age of the
plants. The exact soil depth is difficult to define accurately due to its high
variability across the landscape. The effective soil depth can be reduced by
the presence of bedrock or impermeable layers. Use the Symbology layer file
'SOIL_SISSoilDepth.lyr' based on Valued Field 'Depth'.</span></span></span></p><p><span style='font-size:10.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#333333;'><br />

characteristic that influences processes such as water infiltration rates,
rootability, gas exchanges, leaching, chemical activity, susceptibility to
erosion and water holding capacity. The soil textural class is determined by
the percentage of sand, silt, and clay. Soil texture also influences how much
water is available to the plant; clay soils have a greater water holding
capacity than sandy soils. Use the Symbology layer file
'SOIL_SISSoilTexture.lyr' based on Value Field 'Texture'.</span></span></span></p><p><span style='font-size:10.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#333333;'><br />

by An Foras Taluntais, 14 counties were described in detail with soil profile
descriptions provided for the representative soil series found within a county.
Soil samples were taken at each soil horizon to a depth of 1 meter and analyses
performed for a range of measurements, including soil organic carbon, texture,
cation exchange capacity, pH; however in most cases no bulk density
measurements were taken. This meant that while soil organic carbon
concentrations were available this could not be related to a stock for a given
soil series. In 2012/2013, 246 profile pits were sampled and analysed as part
of the Irish Soil Information System project to fill in gaps in the description
of representative profile data for Ireland. Use the Symbology layer file
'SOIL_SISSoilSOC.lyr' based on Value Field 'SOC'. </span></span></span></p>",2024,https://production-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/maps/0a5d8ad33d1d4efe8afe1d6f8c0526e5,,public

1:40,000. Fieldwork was carried out, around the flanks of large bogs delineate
the exact boundary between peat and mineral soils but predominantly within the
boundary zones of differencing subsoils. Areas mapped during the
photogrammetric analysis were also checked during the fieldwork. Methods
adopted during field mapping include reconnaissance mapping, auger sampling,
trenching, digital photography and GPS data recording. Aerial photography
datasets involved in mapping were acquired in 1995 while field data collected
was collected during 1998-2005.The classification of subsoils is based on the classification
used by the Geological Survey of Ireland Quaternary Section in mapping
Quaternary sediment types.This classification has been altered only to ensure
utility specific to the requirements of the EPA Soil and Subsoil Mapping

The layer has been developed as a proxy to represent SDG 9.1.2 'Passenger and Freight Volumes, by Mode of Transport' for Ireland. The layer was created using data produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) as part of the Road Freight Transport Survey 2016 and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann.Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the
former Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation
(EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission
Regulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info).

In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 9 which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.",2024,https://production-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/irelandsdg::sdg-9-1-2-un-9-50-eu-passenger-and-freight-volumes-by-mode-of-transport-nuts-3-2016-ireland-cso-tailte-éireann,2016,public

Attributes include a breakdown by sex and region. The layer was created using data produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) as part of the CSO's Labour Force Survey Q4 2017 and NUTS 3 boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann. Note that the NUTS 3 boundary refers to the
former Regional Authorities established under the NUTS Regulation (Regulation
(EU) 1059/2003). These boundaries were subsequently revised in 2016 through Commission
Regulation (EU) 2016/2066 amending annexes to Regulation 1059/2003 (more info).

In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 9 which aims to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation.

The geometry is generated by merging the river lines of individual geometric network datasets. This layer contains an integrated flow network that includes known flow connections through rivers, lakes and groundwater aquifers. In places where the network is depicted flowing through lakes or through underground channels, the flow channels are schematic only, and do not represent the precise location of these flow channels. The appropriate Geological Survey Ireland data sets should be consulted where underground flows or connections are known or suspected.</span><div><span style='color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'><br /></span></div><div><p style='background:white;'><span style='font-size:11.5pt; font-family:&quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif; color:#4C4C4C;'>This dataset

The layer has been developed as a proxy to represent SDG 8.5.2 ‘Unemployment rate, by sex, age and persons with disabilities' for Ireland. Census 2016 data produced by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and Electoral Division boundary data produced by Tailte Éireann were used to create this feature layer. Census 2016 Principal Economic Status is used to define unemployment.In 2015 UN countries adopted a set of 17 goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all as part of a new sustainable development agenda. Each goal has specific targets to help achieve the goals set out in the agenda by 2030. Governments are committed to establishing national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals and to review progress using accessible quality data. With these goals in mind the CSO and Tailte Éireann are working together to link geography and statistics to produce indicators that help communicate and monitor Ireland’s performance in relation to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals.The indicator displayed supports the efforts to achieve goal number 8  which aims to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.

These land divisions were formed following the Norman invasion of Ireland in imitation of the counties then in use as units of local government in the Kingdom of England. The older term &quot;shire&quot; was historically equivalent to &quot;county&quot;. The principal function of the county was to impose royal control in the areas of taxation, security and the administration of justice at local level. Following a survey under the 1825 Boundary Survey Act, an extensive series of maps of Ireland was created by the Irish division of the Tailte Éireann for taxation purposes. These maps both documented and standardised the boundaries of the thirty two counties of Ireland.</span></p><p style='font-size:12pt;'><span>Coordinate Reference System: Irish Transverse Mercator.</span></p><p><span style='font-size:16px;'>This dataset is provided by Tailte Éireann </span><br /></p></div>",2024,https://production-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/osi::counties-national-statutory-boundaries-2019,2019,public

Settlements Ungeneralised - National Statistical Boundaries - 2015,"<div style='text-align:left;'><p><span style='font-size:12pt;'>In order to distinguish between the urban and rural population for census analysis, the boundaries of distinct settlements need to be defined. This requires the creation of suburbs and extensions to existing cities and legal towns, as well as delineating boundaries for settlements which are not legally defined (called Census towns). From 1971 to 2006, Census towns were defined as a cluster of fifty or more occupied dwellings where, within a radius of 800 metres there was a nucleus of thirty occupied dwellings (on both sides of a road, or twenty on one side of a road), along with a clearly defined urban centre e.g. a shop, a school, a place of worship or a community centre. Census town boundaries where extended over time where there was an occupied dwelling within 200 metres of the existing boundary. To avoid the agglomeration of adjacent towns caused by the inclusion of low density one off dwellings on the approach routes to towns, the 2011 criteria were tightened, in line with UN criteria. In Census 2011 a new Census town was defined as being a cluster with a minimum of 50 occupied dwellings, with a maximum distance between any dwelling and the building closest to it of 100 metres, and where there was evidence of an urban centre (shop, school etc). The proximity criteria for extending existing 2006 Census town boundaries was also amended to include all occupied dwellings within 100 metres of an existing building. Other information based on </span><span style='font-size:16px;'>Tailte Éireann</span><span style='font-size:12pt;'> mapping and orthogonal photography was taken into account when extending boundaries. Boundary extensions were generally made to include the land parcel on which a dwelling was built or using other physical features such as roads, paths etc. Extensions to the environs and suburbs of legal towns and cities were also constructed using the 100 metre proximity rule applied to Census towns. For census reports, urban settlements are towns with a population of 1,500 or more, while settlements with a population of less than 1,500 are classified as rural.</span></p><p><span style='font-size:16px;'>This dataset is provided by Tailte Éireann </span><br /></p></div>",2024,https://production-geohive.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/osi::settlements-ungeneralised-national-statistical-boundaries-2015,2015,public

Limestone is the most common type of soluble rock. As rain falls it picks up carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air. When this rain reaches the ground and passes through the soil it picks up more CO2 and forms a weak acid solution. The acidified rain water trickles down through cracks and holes in the limestone and over time dissolves the rock. After traveling underground, sometimes for long distances, this water is then discharged at springs, many of which are cave entrances.</span></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 14 0;'><span><span>There are many kinds of karst landforms, ranging in size from millimetres to kilometres. Dolines or sinkholes are small to medium sized enclosed depressions. Uvalas and poljes are large enclosed depressions. A swallow hole is the point where surface stream sinks underground. Turloughs are seasonal lakes. Springs occur where groundwater comes out at the surface, karst springs are usually much bigger than non-karst springs. Estevelles can act as springs or swallow holes. Dry valleys are similar to normal river valleys except they do not have a stream flowing at the bottom. A cave is a natural underground opening in rock large enough for a person to enter. Superficial Solution Features can be seen on rocks dissolved by rain and include pits, grooves, channels, clints (blocks) and grikes (joints).

the Small Area boundary dataset generalised to 20m which affect Small Area
268014010 in Ballygall D, Dublin City. The Small Area boundary dataset
generalised to 20m is in the process of being revised and the updated datasets
will be available as soon as the boundaries are amended. This
feature layer was created using Census 2016 data produced by the Central
Statistics Office (CSO) and Small Areas national boundary data (generalised to
20m) produced by Tailte Éireann. The layer represents
Census 2016 theme 1.1, the total population across Ireland by sex and age.
Attributes include population breakdown by age 0-19 by and sex, and population
aged 20+ by sex and age group (e.g. Age 3 Males, Age 16 Females, Age 75-80
Males). Census 2016 theme 1 represents population by Sex, Age and Marital
status. The Census is carried out every five years by the CSO to determine an
account of every person in Ireland. The results provide information on a range
of themes, such as, population, housing and education. The data were sourced
from the CSO.



The Small Area Boundaries were created with the
following credentials. National boundary dataset. Consistent sub-divisions of
an ED. Created not to cross some natural features. Defined area with a minimum
number of GeoDirectory building address points. Defined area initially created
with minimum of 65 – approx. average of around 90 residential address points.
Generated using two bespoke algorithms which incorporated the ED and Townland

of Eurogeographics,and the generalised scales are based on GISCO Countries 2016 due
to the lack of updates of the UN FAO Gaul dataset. This resulted in a common repository of
geometry of which the different datasets were derived. The different scale levels were derived
of generalisations of the common repository on 100K scale. This means that within each
scale level the feature classes of all these datasets: COMM_2020, NUTS_2021, CNTR_2020,
EEZ_2020 and COAS_2020, are fully coherent and compliant. Each scale level in the
CNTR_2020 dataset consists of 2 feature classes (regions and boundaries) The boundaries
and regions are related to each other through a relationship table. In addition to the region and
boundary feature classes there is also 1 label feature class which is scale independent. For
each CNTR in the region feature class there is exactly 1 label and an associated record in the

OPW Arterial Drainage Channels,"<p style='box-sizing:border-box; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'>Abstract: This data shows Arterial Drainage Scheme (ADS) Channels constructed under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 &amp; 1995, that OPW has a statutory obligation to maintain. These channels are either modified watercourses or constructed channels/drains to enhance the conveyance or constructed to modify the flow regime in an area. The average channel is requiring maintenance every four to six years. However, this varies with some channels requiring maintenance annually and others only requiring maintenance every twenty years. Circa 2,000 km of channels are maintained annually and nearly all of the 11,500 km of channels will have been maintained at least once over the Programme cycle of six years. Arterial Drainage Schemes were carried out under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 to improve land for agricultural purposes. The Act was amended on a number of occasions, for example to transpose EU Regulations and Directives such as the EIA, SEA, and Habitats Directives and the Aarhus Convention. The Arterial Drainage (Amendment) Act, 1995 further allows for the implementation of localised flood relief schemes to provide flood protection for cities, towns and villages. Statutory Arterial Drainage Maintenance entails the maintenance of completed Arterial Drainage Schemes and completed Flood Relief Schemes. The OPW are responsible for the maintenance of 11,500km of channel, 800km of embankments, some 19,000 bridges and further ancillary structures such as weirs, sluice barrages, sluices, pumping stations and tidal flap gates.</p><p style='box-sizing:border-box; margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:10px; color:rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family:&quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica; font-size:15.4px;'>Purpose: This data has been developed to support the maintenance of Arterial Drainage Schemes carried out under the Arterial Drainage Acts 1945 &amp; 1995, that OPW has a statutory obligation to maintain.
