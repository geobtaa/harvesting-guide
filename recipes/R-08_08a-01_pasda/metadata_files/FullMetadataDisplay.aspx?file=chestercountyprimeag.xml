This data set represents Prime Agricultural Soils as defined by
the County of Chester.  The designation equates to any soil map unit
designation as 1 or 2 in the Nonirrigated Capability Class from the SSURGO
data base. The SSURGO data set is a digital soil survey and is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was collected by
digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric
correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using
remotely sensed and other information.

The SSURGO data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a full county
format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. Sometimes a special soil features layer (point
and line features) is included. This layer displays the location of
features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are
large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use
and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
Map Unit Interpretations Record relational data base, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their
properties.

The data set has been provided to Chester County Departments and PASDA as an
ArcView shapefile by the County of Chester, Department of Computer and
Information Services.  The theme has been reprojected to PA Stateplane
NAD83 from its original datum in accordance with the base map standards of
the County of Chester.  The County of Chester serves as the secondary
organization in providing this shapefile, as compared to its originator
and primary organization, the Natural Resources Conservation Service.

                <PRE>Soils digitial data depicts information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. These data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The Prime Agriculture Soils shapefile can be used in various County of Chester Programs which evaluate the location of Prime Agricultural Soils which consist of Capability Class I and II. These data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.</PRE>

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources
Conservation Service, should be acknowledged as the data source in
products derived from these data.

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any
authority for the decisions that they make. The Natural Resources
Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps
for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than at which they were originally mapped can cause
misinterpretation of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the
small areas of contrasting soils that could have been shown at a
larger scale. The depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and
analysis derived from them do not eliminate the need for onsite
sampling, testing, and detailed study of specific sites for
intensive uses. Thus, these data and their interpretations are
intended for planning purposes only. Digital data files are
periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible
for obtaining the latest version of the data.

Attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or on
screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s)
and are current as of the date of digitizing.

Certain node/geometry and topology GT-
polygon/chain relationships are collected or generated to satisfy
topological requirements (the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil
delineation). Some of these requirements include: chains must
begin and end at nodes, chains must connect to each other at
nodes, chains do not extend through nodes, left and right
GT-polygons are defined for each chain element and are consistent
throughout, and the chains representing the limits of the file
(neatline) are free of gaps. The tests of logical consistency are
performed using vendor software. The neatline is generated by
connecting the explicitly entered four corners of the digital file.
All data outside the enclosed region are ignored and all data
crossing these geographically straight lines are clipped at the
neatline. Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline are
snapped to the neatline. Neatline straightening aligns the
digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline
(i.e., with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic
coordinates). All internal polygons are tested for closure with
vendor software and are checked on hard copy plots. All data are
checked for common soil lines (i.e., adjacent polygons with the
same label). Quadrangles are edge matched within the soil survey
area and edge locations generally do not deviate from centerline to
centerline by more than 0.01 inch.

A map unit is a collection of areas defined and
named the same in terms of their soil and/or nonsoil areas. Each
map unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area
and is uniquely identified. Each individual area is a delineation.
Each map unit consists of one or more components.

Soil scientists identify small areas of soils or nonsoil areas
(special soil features) that have properties and behavior
significantly different than the named soils in the surrounding map
unit. Other inclusions that have a minimal effect on use and
management, or those that could not be precisely located, were not
mapped.

Specific limits were established on the classification of soils,
design and name of map units, location of special soil features,
and the percentages of allowable inclusions. These limits are
outlined in U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1975. Soil Taxonomy: A
basic system of soil classification for making and interpreting
soil surveys. Soil Conserv. Serv., U.S. Dep. Agric. Handb. 436.;
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1992. Keys to Soil Taxonomy. SMSS
Technical Monograph No. 19. Soil Surv. Staff, Soil Conserv. Serv.;
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1993. National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI. Soil Surv. Staff, Soil Conserv. Serv.; and
U.S. Department of Agriculture. 1993. Soil Survey Manual. Soil
Surv. Staff, U.S. Dep. Agric. Handb. 18.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on statistical analysis of field
observations and transect data. Adherence to National Cooperative
Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on peer review,
quality control, and quality assurance. Quality control is outlined
in the memorandum of understanding for the soil survey area and in
documents that reside with the Natural Resources Conservation
Service state soil scientist. Four kinds of map units are used in
soil surveys: consociations, complexes, associations, and
undifferentiated groups.

Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil. In
a consociation, delineated areas are dominated by a single soil
taxon and similar soils. At least one half of the pedons in each
delineation are of the same soil component so similar to the
named soil that major interpretations are not affected
significantly. The total amount of dissimilar inclusions of
other components in a map unit generally does not exceed about
15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if nonlimiting. A single
component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion generally does not
exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations are named
for two or more dissimilar components with the dominant
component listed first. They occur in a regularly repeating
pattern. The major components of a complex cannot be mapped
separately at a scale of about 1:24,000. The major components of
an association can be separated at a scale of about 1:24,000. In
each delineation of either a complex or an association, each
major component is normally present, though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

Undifferentiated Groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that do not always occur together in the same
delineation, but are included in the same named map unit because
use and management are the same or similar for common uses.
Every delineation has at least one of the major components and
some may have all of them. The same principles regarding
proportion of inclusions apply to undifferentiated groups as to
consociations.

Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.

A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 4 acres.

The accuracy of these
digital data is based upon their compilation to base maps that
meet National Map Accuracy Standards. The difference in
accuracy between the soil boundaries and special soil
features locations in the field and their digitized map
locations is unknown. The locational accuracy of soil
delineations on the ground varies with the transition between
map units.

For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.

Chester County, Pennsylvania had a previous
soil survey that was published in 1959. Since that time there has been
an dramatic increase in urbanization within the county and an soil
survey update was needed to reflect these changes. A detailed
evaluation found that significant changes in classification, landuse,
outdated soil series, and standards and procedures for making soil
surveys made the 1959 survey obsolete.

The ratioed film positives were used to adjust
soil boundary placement by using control points also found on the
orthophotography. These lines were placed on stable base material
compilation sheets that were then checked matching adjacent sheets as
well as referenceing positions to selected features on the
orthophotographs. Adjustment of soil bounderies reflecting newer urban
areas were made by photointerpretation. The field compilation sheets
were taken and scanned at Midwest Graphics Inc. that scanned at 200 dpi
on a drum scanner. The raster files of the scanned soil lines were
imported into LT4X for raster editing, map neatline develpment,
labeling, edgematching, and vector conversion. The cleaned vector files
were then transferred into ARC/INFO version 7.0.3 for final plotting,
edit checks, and error analysis. The quadrangle format was then joined
together to form a seamless county coverage. Polygon attributes where
checked versus the correlation legend. This process within ARC/INFO was
completed in 1997. Soil labels were checked versus the correlation
legend and tabular data. The spatial data was then exported to the
ARC/INFO exchange format. Compilation, digitizing, and quality control
were performed by the soil scientists and cartographic technicians at
the Pennsylvania Natural Resources Conservation Service Map Compilation
Center.

Map Unit Delineations are closed
polygons that may be dominated by a single soil or nonsoil
component plus allowable similar or dissimilar soils, or they can
be geographic mixtures of groups of soils or soils and nonsoil
areas.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed delineation map
unit. Each symbol is linked to a map unit name. The map unit symbol
is also the key for linking information in the Map Unit
Interpretations Record tables. The map unit symbols are not carried
within the modified Digital Line Graph file; however, they are made
available in a companion attribute file (note - a complete set of these
files are available through NRCS - a select number of attribute fields
have been incorporated into this shapefile for user access.). The
file links the minor codes in the Digital Line Graph files
to the map unit symbols.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the Map Unit Interpretations
Record data base. This attribute data base gives the proportionate
extent of the component soils and the properties for each soil. The
data base contains both estimated and measured data on the physical
and chemical soil properties and soil interpretations for
engineering, water management, recreation, agronomic, woodland,
range, and wildlife uses of the soil. The soil Map Unit
Interpretations Record data base consists of the following
relational tables:
codes (data base codes) - stores information on all codes used
in the data base
comp (map unit component) - stores information for soil map unit
components
compyld (component crop yield) - stores crop yield information
for soil map unit components
forest (forest understory) - stores information for plant cover
as forest understory for soil map unit components
helclass (highly erodible lands class) - stores the highly
erodible land classification for wind and water assigned to
the soil map units
hydcomp (hydric component information) - stores data related to
the hydric classification, criteria, landform, etc.
inclusn (map unit inclusion) - stores the names of soils
included in the soil map units
interp (interpretation) - stores soil interpretation ratings
(both limitation ratings and suitability ratings) for soil
map unit components
layer (soil layer) - stores characteristics of soil layers for
soil map unit components
mapunit (map unit) - stores information that applies to all
components of a soil map unit
mucoacre (map unit county acres) - stores the number of acres
for the map unit within a county
muyld (map unit yield) - stores crop yield information for the
soil map unit
plantcom (plant composition) - stores plant symbols and percent
of plant composition associated with components of a soil
map unit
plantnm (plant name) - stores the common and scientific names
for plants used in the data base
rangenm (range name) - stores the range site names
rsprod (range site production) - stores range site production
information for soil map unit components
ssacoac (soil survey area county acreage) - stores the acreage
for the county within the boundary of the soil survey area
ssarea (soil survey area) - stores information that will apply
to an entire soil survey area
taxclass (taxonomic classification) - stores the taxonomic
classification for soils in the data base
windbrk (windbreak) - stores information on recommended
windbreak plants for soil map unit components
wlhabit (wildlife habitat) - stores wildlife habitat information
for soil map unit components
woodland (woodland) - stores information on common indicator
trees for soil map unit components
woodmgt (woodland management) - stores woodland management
information for soil map unit components
yldunits (yield units) - stores crop names and the units used to
measure yield

Special features are described in the feature table. It includes a
feature label, feature name, and feature definition for each
special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.
