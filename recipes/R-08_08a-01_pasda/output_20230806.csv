"Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania
Digitized regional surficial geology map for northwestern Pennsylvania. The complete citation for the paper map is: Map of the Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania by V.C. Shepps, J.B. Droste, and R.F. Sitler under the supervision of G.W.White, 1959, Bulletin G-32, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. The original map was published at a scale of 1:125,000. Three counties are fully covered by these deposits and mapped (Crawford, Erie, and Mercer); five more are partially covered and mapped (Beaver, Butler, Lawrence, Warren, and Venango). 
This GIS dataset shows the areal distribution of 14 distinct glacial deposits from the Pleistocene Epoch and Recent stream alluvium and/or bedrock exposures. All mapping activity and lithologic interpretations were made by the original authors of the map (Shepps et al., 1959); the authors of this electronic geospatial resource (Shaffer et al., 2005) have only provided digital transfer of the map features and attributes and documentation of the process. Purpose:
This dataset identifies the distribution of surficial unconsolidated sediments (glacial deposits and stream alluvium) in northwestern PA. This map is the only published comprehensive regional surficial geologic map available for the region. The original map was digitized to provide an electronic version for GIS work. Potential users should read the Supplemental Information Section (below) to determine the appropriate scale for using these data. More detailed surficial geologic maps may exist within the mapped area in either paper or electronic format. Researchers are encouraged to check with the U.S. Geological Survey, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, PASDA, and/or Geology Departments at local universities and colleges for other maps.

"Allegheny County - Floodplain
In an effort to expedite the permit review process for Water Obstruction and Encroachment Applications, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection initiated a plan to replace hard-copy maps with digital GIS sets. The project is referred to as the 105 Spatial Data System (105SDS) Pennsylvania river floodplains and coastal floodplains are two of many spatial data sets that were used in the 105SDS project. As a result of work completed by Law Environmental, Inc. on the statewide low-level radioactive waste siting project, DEP received two coverages depicting river and coastal floodplains. However, due to the process used in constructing these data sets, there were many areas throughout the state in which floodplains were not digitized. The primary purpose of this task was to complete the digital floodplain mapping in these areas. 
Purpose: INTENDED USE OF DATA; Created to do permit reviews for Water Obstruction and Encroachment Applications. LIMITATIONS OF DATA; Due to the nature of transferring the floodplains from the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps to plotted 1:24000 scale maps this coverage should be considered to be the ""best representation"" of the data but not as accurate as, for example, a map of Global Positioning System's floodplain coordinates

"Allegheny County - Street Centerlines
This dataset contains street centerlines for vehicular and foot traffic in Allegheny County.  Street Centerlines are classified as Primary Road, Secondary Road, Unpaved Road, Limited Access Road, Connecting Road, Jeep Trail, Walkway, Stairway, Alleyway and Unknown.

A Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction.  A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction.  An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel.  A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway.  A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street.  A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together.  Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature.  A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation.  A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature.  A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed.

Centerlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement.  One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement.  Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present.

For roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement.

All attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated.  For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR.  If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004.  The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified.

The ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps.  Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed.  In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads.
Street Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset.  In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area.

Street Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area.

The Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field.  In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset.  When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004.  All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values.  All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used.  In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection.  Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range.  All new Street Centerlines will have zero (0) for ""SystemID"" and ""UserID"".

"Allegheny County - Street Edge of Pavement
Edge of Pavements are the edges of all public thoroughfares including paved roads, unpaved roads, bridges, overpasses, tunnels, alleys, stairways and airfield runways.

Paved Roads are roads that are surfaced with concrete or asphalt.  Roads that have been tarred and chipped are also considered paved.  Roads surfaced with gravel or packed dirt are considered Unpaved.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than surrounding roads that runs between, but parallel to, two paved roads.  An Alley can be either paved or unpaved.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  Road pavement edges that are underneath bridges or overpasses are coded as Hidden.  Bridges and Overpasses are delineated along the outside edge of the structure.  Portions of bridges that are under other bridges or other objects are coded as Hidden Bridge.  Tunnels are shown as lines connecting the apparent width of the tunnel through the earth.  Stairways are major pedestrian thoroughfares, either paved or wooden, connecting two (2) roads and typically found on steep hills.  Airfield Runways are the edges of Runways, Taxiways and other airfield pavement areas.  Driveways that are greater than 300' in length will be digitized and coded as either Paved Road or Unpaved Road.

Paved Road edges show the width of the paved area.  If the paved road has a paved shoulder, the paved shoulder is shown as part of the paved road.  The placement of an unpaved road is subject to interpretation by the photogrammetrist since the road edge may be indefinite due to the imprecise nature of an unpaved surface.

Driveways that are over 300' in length are digitized.  For a driveway that terminates at a building, it shall be drawn to the building.  Driveways will also have a centerline for its entire length.

Parking lots are not digitized.  The entrance to a parking lot for shopping areas shall be shown.  Driving areas around and through parking lots serving shopping areas and other businesses are considered part of the parking lot.  If the driving area through a parking lot connects to two (2) or more exterior roads, the main thoroughfare through the parking lot shall be shown as a road.

The driving area through an apartment complex or condominium complex shall be digitized as a road.  The road is needed in these areas to show access to the individual dwelling places.

Edges of Pavement that are updated will have the database field StreetCL_FC populated with the Feature Code of the Street Centerline.  (The Street Centerline Feature Code is more descriptive than the general code used for Edge of Pavement.)

"Allegheny County -Tree Canopy Change, 2010-2015
Tree canopy change in Allegheny County Pennsylvania for the years 2010 to 2015. This tree canopy change data set consists of three classes: no change, gain, and loss. No change polygons are those in which the tree canopy remained the same between the two time periods. Gain polygons are those in which tree canopy increased between the two time periods. Loss polygons are those in which tree canopy decrease between the two time periods. 2010 tree canopy can be calculated by adding the “no change” and loss classes. Tree canopy for 2015 can be calculated by adding the “no change” and “gain” classes.Several data sets were used to map tree canopy change. The starting point was the 2010 high-resolution land cover data set developed for Allegheny County. Change was then mapped using leaf-off lidar data collected in 2006, 4-band leaf-on National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) data collected in 2010, leaf off lidar data collected in 2015, and 4-band leaf-on NAIP data collected in 2015. All four data sets were integratedinto an object-based image analysis system (OBIA), which a rule-based expert system. A combination of segmentation, classification, and morphology algorithms were employed to determine if tree canopy had changed between the two time periods. The data set was then manually edited at a scale of 1:5000. The main factors determining change were a decrease in height, indicating tree removal, as identified by the lidar, and the change in the spectral characteristics, as identified in the aerial imagery. There were spatial misalignment issues between all four of the data sets. As a result, very fine scale changes at the edges of tree canopy could not be determined. The data set can thus be considered to be slightly biased towards tree canopy loss, and fine-scale tree canopy gains could not be determined. Most of the gain identified is not new growth, but rather canopy from trees that were too small to be detected in the original 2010 mapping.The incorporation of newer lidar data enabled a revisit of the original 2010 tree canopy mapping. The 2015 lidar data was substantially higher quality than the 2006 lidar data used for the 2010 high-resolution land cover mapping project. This enabled errors of omission and commission in the original 2010 tree canopy mapping to be corrected. Examples include shrubby areas in 2010 falsely classified as tree canopy and tall trees that were not clearly visible in the data used to map tree canopy in 2010. This data set should be considered to be the most accurate depiction of tree canopy for both the 2010 and 2015 time periods.

"Urban Ecosystem Analysis Ikonos interpreted land cover for the Cobbs/Mill Creek and Tacony/Frankford Creek watersheds
AMERICAN FORESTS conducted an urban ecosystem analysis of the Delaware Valley region to provide community leaders with detailed information about the region's tree cover and its environmental and economic impacts. The analysis documents what landscape changes have occurred over time and how these changes have impacted the environmental services the urban forest provides to the region. The study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to connect image analysis of the area to ecological assessment of tree cover change trends over the last 15 years. In addition, AMERICAN FORESTS created a ""green data layer"" -a digital tool that local communities can use to integrate urban forest ecology into their future planning. 

Frankford Tacony, Mill Creek and Cobbs Creek in Pennsylvania and the Big Timber in New Jersey were selected for analysis and to create a detailed (4-meter resolution) digital landcover.  The detailed analysis used a high-resolution satellite image as the basis for creating a ""green data layer"" or classified land cover image.  This digital mapping tool enables planners to integrate green infrastructure into their future planning.

The study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology to connect image analysis of the area to ecological assessment of tree cover change trends over the last 15 years. In addition, AMERICAN FORESTS created a ""green data layer"" -a digital tool that local communities can use to integrate urban forest ecology into their future planning. 

Frankford Tacony, Mill Creek and Cobbs Creek in Pennsylvania and the Big Timber in New Jersey were selected for analysis and to create a detailed (4-meter resolution) digital landcover.  The detailed analysis used a high-resolution satellite image as the basis for creating a ""green data layer"" or classified land cover image.

The hubs and corridors are the major concentration of the map and serve as the core conservation areas in the PA Highlands Greenway. The hub and spoke system was created by AMC by combining the results of two analysis techniques, stronghold analysis and the Natural Lands Trust’s Smart ConservationTM.. Stronghold analysis identifies areas that are least affected by man-made disturbances such as roads and fragmentation of the natural landscape while Smart Conservation determines the ecological health of an area. The combination of these two analyses in conjunction with the knowledge of local stakeholders was used to prioritize core conservation areas.

"Allegheny County: Landscape Ecology and Green Infrastructure
The 3 Rivers 2nd Nature project was directed by artists/researchers Tim Collins and Reiko Goto. The project addressed the meaning, form, and function of public space and nature in Allegheny County, PA, U.S.A. This is the region that encompasses the former steel industry capital of the United States, Pittsburgh PA, U.S.A. 3 Rivers 2nd Nature focused upon the three major rivers; the Allegheny, the Monongahela, and the Ohio Rivers, as well as the streams and subwatersheds. This five-year project revisited questions of nature and post-industrial public space, first addressed on the Nine Mile Run Greenway Project. The focus of the work is research to benefit the public realm, applied as strategic knowledge with accompanying outreach programs intended to enable creative public advocacy and change.

The 3 Rivers 2nd Nature conducted integrative analysis and instrumental planning based upon the rigorous field studies that began in the year 2000. The work effort focused upon partnerships to accomplish interdisciplinary analysis, spatial mapping, and concept design within and among specific communities. The work culminated with an ecological design plan and a water quality policy report that analyzed alternatives for ongoing water quality sampling. Finally, the project team has organized the ""Monongahela Conferences"" and the subsequent 2005 ""Groundworks"" exhibition (October 2005) to examine the artist's role in social and environmental change.

A land cover map of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed plus the non-watershed components of counties that intersect the Watershed. The map has 17 cover classes modified from the Anderson Level II system. Landsat remotely sensed data and additional thematic data bases were used to create the map. A decision-tree classification was used, together with ad hoc algorithms to improve local accuracies. Landsat 7 ETM+ data were acquired for three seasons. The spatial accuracy is nominally 30m, but accuracy increases rapidly at larger minimum mapping units and, as a general rule, the map should not be used below 1ha (100m x 100m) resolution. The map extends beyond the watershed but has not been validated outside the watershed boundary and the intersecting counties.

"Landscape Ecological Assessment of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed
Multiple TIFF and layer files pertaining to Landscape ecological assessment of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Chesapeake Bay Watershed, located in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States, is experiencing rapid habitat loss and fragmentation from sprawling low-density development. The bay itself is heavily stressed by excess sediment and nutrient runoff. Three states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government signed an agreement in 2000 to address these problems. The commitments included an assessment of the watershed's resource lands, and targeting the most valued lands for protection. As part of this task, the Resource Lands Assessment identified an ecological network comprised of large contiguous blocks (hubs) of forests, wetlands, and streams, interconnected by corridors to allow animal and plant propagule dispersal and migration. Hubs were prioritized by ecoregion, by analyzing a variety of ecological parameters, including: rare species presence, rarity and population viability; vegetation and vertebrate richness; habitat area, condition, and diversity; intactness and remoteness; connectivity potential; and the nature of the surrounding landscape. I found that much of the watershed was still fairly intact, although this varied dramatically by ecoregion. Current protection also varied, and an assessment of vulnerability will help focus protection efforts among the most valuable hubs and corridors. MORE INFORMATION -

This dataset is a combination of both bike racks installed in 2008 as a result of Adopt-a-rack program and racks installed by converting parking meters by the Philadelphia Parking Authority. 

Those racks installed in 2008 as part of the City's first Adopt-a-rack program were requested by civic and business associations who ""adopted"" them and promised to clear abandoned bikes, remove graffiti and maintain them if they were damaged. These bike racks are in the style of 'staple' or 'hoop' racks.

The PPA racks are those mounted to the former parking meter posts. They are the green discs that have been installed through Center City and parts of University City.


The PROJECT field defines the associated project of installation, either Adopt-a-rack or PPA.

The STAND_ADD field is most appropriate for address locating or geocoding purposes.

Please note the field NUM_RACKS represents the number of racks at a given address. Each record may represent more than one bike rack.

"Philadelphia Census Block Groups
The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Some boundary details clarified by Philadelphia City Planning Commission May 2011

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Some boundary details clarified by Philadelphia City Planning Commission May 2011",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/download/philacity/data/PhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.zip,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=135,pasda-135,"-75.280266,39.867004,-74.955763,40.137992",unspecified data,Datasets

"Philadelphia Census Tracts 2010
Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

"Philadelphia Land Cover Raster 2008
High resolution land cover dataset for Philadelphia.  Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at ten square feet. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 Orthophotography and 2008 LiDAR LAS data.  Ancillary data sources included GIS data (building footprints, road polygons, and hydrography) provided by City of Philadelphia. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2008. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.  More than 30700 corrections were made to the classification.

"Philadelphia Water - PWD Parcels
The primary purpose of PWD_PARCEL layer is to calculate parcel-based stormwater charges for PWD customers under the new parcel-based stormwater billing program.  The layer was created from the DOR_PARCELS layer in 2005 after it was decided that none of the other City parcel layers could meet the needs of PWD's stormwater billing program.  Those needs are generally that the parcel delineations match up to what people actually own, that there is an accurate assessment of the impervious area on the parcel, and that there is owner information associated with the parcel.  Over the past 5 years, PWD has made corrections based off deeds on file with DOR, BRT information, and other City records.  PWD also matched up each DOR parcel to a corresponding BRT record that contained the owner information for that parcel.

"United States Protected Areas (PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition))
Protected areas are cornerstones of national and international conservation strategies. By way of these designations, lands and waters are set-aside in-perpetuity to preserve functioning natural ecosystems, act as refuges for species, and maintain ecological processes. Complementary conservation strategies preserve land for the sustainable use of natural resources, or for the protection of significant geologic and cultural features or open space. PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) attempts to include all available spatial data on these places. It is our goal to publish the most comprehensive geospatial data set of U. S. protected areas to date.  

PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) is limited to the continental U.S.,  Alaska, and Hawaii. It does not include protected areas data for U.S. territories at this time.

The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) data set portrays the nation's protected areas with a standardized spatial geometry and numerous valuable attributes on land ownership, management designations, and conservation status (using national GAP and international IUCN coding systems).  The PAD-US 1.1 (CBI Edition) defines protected area to include all lands dedicated to the preservation of biology diversity and to other natural, recreation and cultural uses, and managed for these purposes through legal or other effective means (adapted from IUCN definition). The database represents the full range of conservation designations that preserve these natural resources in the United States. Our database does not distinguish a protection threshold above which biodiversity is considered secure. Instead, a complete suite of protected area attributes are provided for each polygon with the purpose of giving users the information they need to define the most relevant conservation thresholds for their own objectives and requirements.  Collaborating with the nation's leading data providers, the goal is to provide an annual update.

This dataset, produced by the PAMAP Program, consists of a raster digital elevation model with a horizontal ground resolution of 3.2 feet.  The model was constructed from PAMAP LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) elevation points. PAMAP data are organized into blocks, which do not have gaps or overlaps, that represent 10,000 feet by 10,000 feet on the ground. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum:NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half of the state are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. A block name is formed by concatenating the first four digits of the State Plane northing and easting defining the block's northwest corner, the State identifier ""PA"", and the State Plane zone designator ""N"" or ""S"" (e.g. 45001210PAS).

Orthoimagery for south-central Pennsylvania captured in April of 2003. An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. For this dataset, the natural color orthoimages were produced at 2-feet pixel resolution. The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 4.8 feet at the 95% confidence level. Each orthoimage provides imagery for a 10,000 by 10,000 feet block on the ground. The projected coordinate system is Pennsylvania State Plane with a NAD83 datum. There is no image overlap been adjacent files. The ortho image filenames were derived from the northwest corner of each ortho tile using the first four digits of the northing and easting coordinates referenced to the Pennsylvania State Plane coordinate system, followed by the State designator ""PA"", and the State Plane zone designator ""S"".

The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum:NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half of the state are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. A block name is formed by concatenating the first four digits of the State Plane northing and easting defining the block's northwest corner, the State identifier ""PA"", and the State Plane zone designator ""N"" or ""S"" (e.g. 45001210PAS).",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PAMAP_CountyMosaicsCycle2.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PAMAP_CountyMosaicsCycle2.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/download/pamap/pamap_imagery/cycle2/mosaics/,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1287,pasda-1287,"-80.52,39.72,-74.69,42.51",unspecified data,Datasets

Mosaic - An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  This project consists of the creation of 3-band, 24 bit color digital orthophoto tiles for the 5-county, Pennsylvania portion DVRPC?s region utilizing a Leica ADS40 digital imaging system.  The tiles were delivered in both GeoTIFF and MrSID MG3 formats.  A GeoTIFF is a TIFF file which has geographic (or cartographic) data embedded as tags within the TIFF file. The geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and geometry within a geographic information system (GIS) display.  MrSID (Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database) is a proprietary, wavelet-based, image compression file format (*.sid) developed and patented by LizardTech, Inc.  A 20:1 compression ratio was used for the MrSIDs.  The complete data set contains 1,540 full ortho tiles in Pennsylvania State Plane South coordinate system, NAD83.  The individual tiles measure 5,055' x 8,745' at a 1.0' pixel size.  There is no image overlap between adjacent tiles. Counties include: Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia.

The tiles were delivered in both GeoTIFF and MrSID MG3 formats.  A GeoTIFF is a TIFF file which has geographic (or cartographic) data embedded as tags within the TIFF file. The geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and geometry within a geographic information system (GIS) display.  MrSID (Multi-resolution Seamless Image Database) is a proprietary, wavelet-based, image compression file format (*.sid) developed and patented by LizardTech, Inc.  A 20:1 compression ratio was used for the MrSIDs.  The complete data set contains 1,540 full ortho tiles in Pennsylvania State Plane South coordinate system, NAD83.  The individual tiles measure 5,055' x 8,745' at a 1.0' pixel size.  There is no image overlap between adjacent tiles.

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM Zone 18, NAD83 (2011), meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (GEOID12A), meters. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 25 individual 1500 meter X 1500 meter tiles for the pilot (3752 individual 1500 meter X 1500 meter tiles for the entire project area), Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1500 meter X 1500 meter tile schema, and Breaklines in Esri shapefile format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring of 2015, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established 76 calibration control points in order to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the Delaware Valley project area. The accuracy of the data was checked with 91 NVA points and 70 VVA points (161 total QC checkpoints).

"DVRPC Historic Digital Imagery (multiple years) 1959, 1965-1995
Prior to the year 2000, DVRPC’s aerial imagery consisted of mylar aerial photo
enlargements or “atlas sheets”. These atlas sheets were produced from 9x9"" aerial
photos. The imagery dates from the years 1959, 1965, 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990,
& 1995. The 1959s and 1965s primarily cover the urbanized portion of
the DVRPC region (the DVRPC region is made up of nine counties: Bucks, Chester,
Delaware, Montgomery, and Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; Burlington, Camden,
Gloucester, and Mercer in New Jersey). Subsequent years provide full coverage of the
region, minus the occasional missing scan.
In order to increase the efficiency of using the historical aerial imagery, the sheets were
scanned into TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) files. Each TIFF file ranges between 35-
40MB in size. Unlike DVRPC’s more recent aerial imagery (2000 and later), the
historical aerials are not “orthorectified” or “orthocorrected”. In other words, they are
simply aerial images with no spatial reference or uniform scale. Through the process of
georeferencing, the scanned images can be assigned a spatial reference which will
enable them to be used more readily in a GIS environment. That said, georeferencing is
not orthorectifying or orthocorrecting. What it does allow is for the scan to be displayed
relative to other spatially referenced GIS layers. A georeferenced scan does not have
the properties of an actual orthoimage. Whereas an orthoimage can be used for making
accurate measurements, a georeferenced image cannot, as it does not have the spatial
accuracy and uniform scale of an orthoimage.

"Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture
The Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture (EBTJV) is the nation's first pilot project under the National Fish Habitat Initiative, which directs locally-driven efforts that build private and public partnerships to improve fish habitat. The long-term goals of the EBTJV are to develop a comprehensive restoration and education strategy to improve aquatic habitat, to raise education awareness, and to raise federal, state and local funds for brook trout conservation.

In 2005, in recognition of the need to address regional and range-wide threats to brook trout, a group of public and private entities formed the EBTJV to halt the decline of brook trout and restore fishable populations. The group spearheaded a range-wide assessment of brook trout populations and threats to brook trout and brook trout habitat in the Eastern United States (report forthcoming). Seventeen states are currently drafting strategies to prioritize policy changes and on-the-ground actions to improve water quality and restore brook trout habitat and populations in their individual state using locally-driven, incentive-based, and non-regulatory programs.

In 2005, in recognition of the need to address regional and range-wide threats to brook trout, a group of public and private entities formed the EBTJV to halt the decline of brook trout and restore fishable populations. The group spearheaded a range-wide assessment of brook trout populations and threats to brook trout and brook trout habitat in the Eastern United States (report forthcoming). Seventeen states are currently drafting strategies to prioritize policy changes and on-the-ground actions to improve water quality and restore brook trout habitat and populations in their individual state using locally-driven, incentive-based, and non-regulatory programs.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=EBTJV.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=EBTJV.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/download/other_states/far/EBTJV_GIS_Data.zip,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=2233,pasda-2233,"-84.921378,32.368076,-66.036941,49.459651",unspecified data,Datasets

"Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map Database, Delaware
The National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) data incorporates all Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) databases published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and any Letters Of Map Revision (LOMRs) that have been issued against those databases since their publication date. It is updated on a monthly basis. The FIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper FIRMs. The FIRM Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The FIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published FIRMs, flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by FEMA. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all FIRM Databases and corresponding LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set. The specification for the horizontal control of FIRM Databases is consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. This file is georeferenced to the Earth's surface using the Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) and North American Dataum of 1983 (NSRS-2007).

"FEMA Historic Flood Maps
FEMA Historic Products - Once a FIRM or FIS has been superseded by a new version, it will be categorized as a Historic Product. After they move to this status, these products are no longer official and binding under the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program). However, Historic Products may serve as valuable reference information and provide a record of an area's changing flood risks over time. They are made available on the Map Service Center for these purposes. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) that were issued to amend Historic Products when they were still effective are also listed here. A LOMC is a formal document that communicates an official modification to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). LOMCs are issued in place of a physical alteration and re-publication of the map. Regulatory Mapping Products Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) - The official map of a community on which FEMA has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. Full FIRM panels are quite large (36' x 25.875'), so most users will prefer to print out a smaller selected portion called a FIRMette. This can be accomplished by selecting ""View"" once you have located your FIRM or by using the FIRMette - Desktop application. Flood Insurance Study (FIS) - A compilation and presentation of flood risk data for specific watercourses, lakes and coastal flood hazard areas within a community. The FIS report provides a detailed written account of a flood hazard mapping study and its findings. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) - Documents, including different types of Letters of Map Revision (LOMR) and Letters of Map Amendment (LOMA), that are issued by FEMA to revise or amend the flood hazard information shown on the FIRM without requiring the FIRM to be physically revised and republished. In addition, FEMA issues a formal determination letter, called a LOMC Revalidation or LOMC-VALID letter - when one or more previously issued LOMCs are found to still be valid during a new flood mapping study of an area. Revalidation letters are included in the LOMC product results on this site.

After they move to this status, these products are no longer official and binding under the NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program). However, Historic Products may serve as valuable reference information and provide a record of an area's changing flood risks over time. They are made available on the Map Service Center for these purposes. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) that were issued to amend Historic Products when they were still effective are also listed here.

It is updated on a monthly basis. The FIRM Database is the digital, geospatial version of the flood hazard information shown on the published paper FIRMs. The FIRM Database depicts flood risk information and supporting data used to develop the risk data. The primary risk classifications used are the 1-percent-annual-chance flood event, the 0.2-percent-annual-chance flood event, and areas of minimal flood risk. The FIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published FIRMs, flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by FEMA. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all FIRM Databases and corresponding LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set. The specification for the horizontal control of FIRM Databases is consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000.

The FIRM Database is derived from Flood Insurance Studies (FISs), previously published FIRMs, flood hazard analyses performed in support of the FISs and FIRMs, and new mapping data, where available. The FISs and FIRMs are published by FEMA. The NFHL is available as State or US Territory data sets. Each State or Territory data set consists of all FIRM Databases and corresponding LOMRs available on the publication date of the data set. The specification for the horizontal control of FIRM Databases is consistent with those required for mapping at a scale of 1:12,000. This file is georeferenced to the Earth's surface using the Geographic Coordinate System (GCS) and North American Dataum of 1983 (NSRS-2007).

"Riparian Buffer Assessment
During 2011 - 2012, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP), as part of the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program and Pennsylvania Stream ReLeaf, funded Heritage Conservancy to develop a rapid assessment method to identify and map sections of stream lacking riparian forest buffers. Montgomery County Planning Commission provided in-kind funding for the project as well as completing the assessment portion in Montgomery Count. Heritage Conservancy completed the assessment for the areas in Bucks County and Philadelphia County. Both organizations then mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers. The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams. The 1' pixel resolution 2010 aerials from DVRPC served as the basis for the riparian conditions along the waterways. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). This dataset is an assessment of the same area completed back in 200-2004. The same methodology of creating 50 foot buffers from the edge of water to assess the tree cover in this area was used. The stream centerline is used to represent the classification of whether one side, both sides, or neither side has tree cover. In addition to the three categories from the previous assessment, the category of culvert was added to incorporate areas where there was not an opportunity for tree cover.

"Riparian Buffers for Southeast Pennsylvania
During 2000 - 2004, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP), as part of the Coastal Zone Management (CZM) Program and Pennsylvania Stream ReLeaf, funded Heritage Conservancy to develop a rapid assessment method to identify and map sections of stream lacking riparian forest buffers. The conservancy then assessed various watersheds in southeastern Pennsylvania and mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers.  The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams.

Interpretation of 1"" = 400' black-and-white high altitude aerial photographs, Orthophotos, and videotape from helicopter over flights were used to determine the presence or absence of a forested buffer for 1,200 miles of stream. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS).

A series of large-scale (1"" = 400') maps were produced showing sections of stream bank lacking forest buffers. Local conservation groups were given the maps to assist them in targeting areas for riparian buffer plantings to improve water quality.

"Riparian Streams - Berks County
This is a county wide analysis of Berks County waterways to determine riparian buffer values given a 50 ft., 50% canopy coverage requirement.

The analysis was done by first overlaying the stream shapefile on the orthophotos.  Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added.  Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile.  The canopy coverage percentage was interpreted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement.  At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none).  

   - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream.
   - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.
   - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.

The threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft.  If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines.  Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline.  In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides.

Ponds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis.  Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value.  

Edits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious.  The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes.  The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines.  

Stream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value.  

Ten sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007.

"Lancaster County - Land Use Types
Polygon coverage representing the predominant land use or land cover, as interpreted from aerial photography. Note: GDI delineated the land use boundaries using aerial photographs dated March 1993 and using a minimum mapping unit of one-half acre. Based on acquired aerial photography, subsequent updates have been made using aerial photos from: 1998, 2002, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2018. ADR compiled land use polygons for all surface water features. NWI wetlands areas were identified using boundaries from a Quad-based wetland coverage; the wetland boundaries were then delineated using the aerial photography. Land uses are categorized using the Modified Anderson Level II classification system. Quality control check plots were produced at 1""=250' scale the whole county. Planning Commission staff reviewed all of the check plots and forwarded comments and corrections to GDI. GDI made some of the corrections but did not make others, claiming that they were below the half-acre minimum mapping unit limit. Planning Commission staff has also made corrections where they have been found.

These ESRI shape files are of National Park Service tract and boundary data that was created by the Land Resources Division. Tracts are numbered and created by the regional cartographic staff at the Land Resources Program Centers and are associated to the Land Status Maps. This data should be used to display properties that NPS owns and properties that NPS may have some type of interest such as scenic easements or right of ways. Spatial data contained herein represent the administrative boundary of the Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River (UPDE) as defined in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan. The data are intended for general GIS analysis, display, planning, and reference purposes only. The spatial data contained herein are a digital representation of the Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River's administrative boundary. These digital data were derived from the official version of the boundary as represented in hard-copy form in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan, as approved in the 1987 Record of Decision. The plan boundary, which was established to meet the resource protection requirements set forth in the Wild and Scenic Rvers Act and in the Special Statutory Provisions for the Upper Delaware, was delineated so as to encompass ""lands from which runoff drains directly into the river and tributary drainages upstream to the first prominent topographic feature"" (River Management Plan, 1986). The authoritative area of the boundary as given in the 1986 River Management Plan is 55,574.5 acres. At present, the National Park Service owns approximately 31 acres within the boundary, and the remaining land is mostly privately owned, with some state and local government holdings. The boundary was digitized based on the eight pages of maps from the River Management Plan georeferenced to 7.5 minute quadrangle topo maps from the USGS Historical Topographic Map Collection.

These digital data were derived from the official version of the boundary as represented in hard-copy form in the 1986 Upper Delaware Scenic & Recreational River Management Plan, as approved in the 1987 Record of Decision. The plan boundary, which was established to meet the resource protection requirements set forth in the Wild and Scenic Rvers Act and in the Special Statutory Provisions for the Upper Delaware, was delineated so as to encompass ""lands from which runoff drains directly into the river and tributary drainages upstream to the first prominent topographic feature"" (River Management Plan, 1986). The authoritative area of the boundary as given in the 1986 River Management Plan is 55,574.5 acres. At present, the National Park Service owns approximately 31 acres within the boundary, and the remaining land is mostly privately owned, with some state and local government holdings. The boundary was digitized based on the eight pages of maps from the River Management Plan georeferenced to 7.5 minute quadrangle topo maps from the USGS Historical Topographic Map Collection.

In the original APCAW (v2) the Open Space Institute (OSI) sought to develop a metric to measure the relative capacity of small scale (HUC12) watersheds to produce clean surface and ground water. In 2014, two different HUC12-based metrics (i.e., “Ability to Produce Good Quality Surface Water” and “Ability to Produce Good Quality Ground Water”) were calculated and used by OSI to evaluate land protection projects. In 2015, OSI combined these two metrics into one metric that considers watershed conditions (e.g. land cover, terrain, and hydrology) and their effects on the abundance and quality of surface and ground water within a reasonably-sized watershed (i.e., HUC12 boundary). The revised index the APCAWv2 makes a number of changes to the original work, notably watershed boundaries are now based on the National Hydrography Dataset Plus version 2 Horizon Systems and EPA.

"Delaware River Watershed Initiative - Soils
Two seamless soils datasets based on USDA’s SSURGO and STATSGO databases were created for the entire DRB region, and information pertaining to various soil-related factors such as erodibility (k factor), available water - holding capacity, texture, etc. were compiled and summarized for discrete mapping units at these two scales. The SSURGO (Soil Survey Geographic) database is compiled at the detailed county-level survey scale that most soil information users are familiar with, and has two basic components: 1) digital boundaries of the detailed soil mapping units, and 2) tabular information on a wide range of soil parameters associated with each mapping unit. The STATSGO (State Soil Geographic) database summarizes similar soils information at a much more generalized “soil association” scale. Both of these datasets for the DRB area were downloaded from USDA’s “geospatial data” site at http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov. Once downloaded, considerable effort was then expended to first 
seam together the data from the separate states overlapping the DRB, and then to “populate” both soil databases by linking a number of “attribute tables” to the soils polygons contained within the DRB boundary. In this case, over 325,000 soil polygons were populated with information extracted from about a dozen different attribute tables.

The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD 1983 HARN StatePlane Pennsylvania North FIPS 3701 Feet, Foot US.
 Ground Conditions: Imagery was collected in spring 2022, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the imagery data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS horizontal accuracy guidelines, NV5 Geospatial utilized a total of 119 ground control points to assess the horizontal accuracy of the data.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PEMA_Cycle2_2022.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PEMA_Cycle2_2022.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/download/pema/pema_imagery/cycle2/,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=5179,pasda-5179,"-80.568082493,41.7516673092,-80.5302612099,41.7799829662",unspecified data,Datasets

"Bedrock Geology of Pennsylvania
The 1980 Pennsylvania state geologic map (Berg and others, 1980) shows the areal distribution of 194 bedrock geologic units. The units range in geologic age from Quaternary to Precambrian and encompass a wide variety of lithologies. The map was compiled and published in a transverse mercator projection at 1:250,000 scale. The two digital data sets include 195 geologic units, which, for the most part, closely correspond to those shown on the 1980 map. The data sets were prepared using ArcInfo software and are provided in a geographic coordinate system (units in decimal degrees). Although it is possible to portray digital data at any scale, the geologic formational contacts, faults, and dikes represented in these data sets are not intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:250,000.

"Bedrock Surface Topography Digital Elevation Raster of Pennsylvania
PaGS assembled 214,851 relevant well records from Pennsylvania, GroundWater Information System (PaGWIS) and other unpublished PaGS reports. Each well used in the analysis contains a measurement of the depth to bedrock (in feet) and/or a notation indicating if bedrock was encountered during well drilling, these attributes allow well records to be separated into two datasets – bedrock wells (wells that penetrate bedrock) and drift wells (wells that did not encounter bedrock).Topographic Position Index (TPI) is a quantitative landform analysis that uses land surface elevation data to determine landforms such as ridge, upper slope, middle/flat slope, lower slope, and valley. A composite TPI raster for each of Pennsylvania’s 23 physiographic sections was generated. Each well data point was attributed to a physiographic section and assigned a TPI value based on its location. The square root of depth-to-bedrock was calculated for each well. A linear regression relationship between the TPI and the square root of sediment thickness was established for five TPI classes (ridge, upper slope, middle/flat slope, lower slope, and valley) in each of the 23 physiographic sections. This statistical relationship was used to create a surrogate model for depth to bedrock to predict sediment thickness across the state. Synthetic data points were generated from the surrogate model to fill in areas of low well data density. A combination of bedrock well data points and synthetic data points were used to generate the first-iteration sediment thickness model through a natural neighbor interpolation technique. Iterative refinements to the sediment thickness model were made by comparing model predictions to drift well data points. If the total depth of the drift well was less than the predicted thickness of sediment at that location, then the drift well data point was ignored. If the total depth of a drift well was greater than the predicted thickness of sediment at that location, then the drift well data point was added to dataset and a new sediment thickness model was generated. In total, 413, 474 data points were used in the modeling process – 207,130 empirically derived well points and 206, 344 synthetic points derived from the surrogate model.The final sediment thickness model was resampled to a 100-meter grid digital raster conforming to a similar resolution surface topography digital elevation raster. The surface topography grid was smoothed to remove detail before subtracting the sediment thickness to create a bedrock elevation map. The degree of smoothing was applied proportionally to the magnitude of sediment thickness. Portions of the surface topography grid that correspond to sediment thickness greater than 365 feet received the maximum amount of smoothing; likewise, portions of the surface topography grid that correspond to zero sediment thickness received no smoothing. The remaining portions of the surface topography grid that correspond to sediment thickness between 0 and 365 feet received gradational smoothing proportional to the sediment thickness.This 100-meter grid bedrock elevation raster was calculated by subtracting the sediment thickness model from the conditionally-smoothed surface topography digital elevation raster.

"Digital data set of mapped karst features in south-central and southeastern Pennsylvania
This point dataset represents an (incomplete) inventory of karst features (herein categorized as sinkholes, surface depressions, surface mines, or cave entrances) that have been cataloged in Pennsylvania by the staff of the Pennsylvania Geological Survey since 1985. County-wide karst-feature inventories for fourteen counties (Adams, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Chester, Cumberland, Dauphin, Franklin, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, and York) were originally released as hard-copy open file reports by the agency. The user of this dataset would be well served to consult one of those reports for specifics on how the inventories were conducted. Data are also provided from incidental reports of karst features as well as partial or cursory inventories in eight additional counties (Bedford, Blair, Clinton, Fulton, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lycoming, and Mifflin). 

The majority of these features were identified on contact prints of USDA, USGS, and other aerial photography. Photo locations were then transferred to paper copies of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangles where the coordinates for the locations were determined using a constantly evolving array of technologies from mylar overlay grids, through early proprietary mapping software and more recently with GIS and GPS technology. . Some features in urbanized areas were identified via questionnaires that were sent to the municipalities in the counties being inventoried. The locations of surface mines and cave entrances were garnered from historical geological publications. 

Locations of historical iron mines and other activities often associated with karst features were garnered from historical geological publications. 

Field surveys were undertaken to establish protocol for future mapping efforts as well as to verify the field presence of interpreted features. Field verified sites are not identified in the data set.

Karst features change considerably over time. Sinkholes become filled or subsidence is repaired. One of the motivations for the karst inventory program was the rapid development taking place in many of the counties where karst could be a problem. Development obliterates much of the evidence for underlying karst features.

Limits of Clearance (LOC) for infrastructure development of shale gas activities on state forest land as of December 31, 2012.  This dataset was used in part to develop the Bureau of Forestry’s Shale Gas Monitoring Report (released April 2014).  This dataset is intended to represent areas where vegetation would be removed or altered due to shale gas development. This area tends to be equal to or less than DEP permitted Limits of Disturbance (LOD). The permitted LOD can include erosion & sedimentation measures that do not impact surface vegetation (such as silt sock). LOC typically include the area where gas infrastructure is developed such as roads, pads and pipelines and the additional workspace cleared for the project. Shale gas related development projects tend to be adjacent to each other and could possibly be attributed to several types of development (pads, roads, pipelines). The individual features have been arbitrarily assigned to a single type of development to avoid counting the same areas several times. Portions of the LOC may be reclaimed or allowed to revert back to natural vegetation within the near future, and is therefore not necessarily an accurate measure of vegetated areas permanently converted to non-vegetation.

"Late Wisconsinan Glacial Border 1:100,000
Late in 1994, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey was
asked to develop a digital physiographic provinces map at 1:100,000 scale. The
then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at
1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic
provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having
20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned
using  published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic
interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was
used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New
scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian
Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision
of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and
transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section
boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the
mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with
physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late
Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries
in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset
containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the
late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section
boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other
datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional
work.
A companion dataset consisting of the state and county boundaries of Pennsylvania
was compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000-scale
digital-line-graph (DLG) files for boundaries. The dataset has been attributed
with the county names.

Developed by the US Forest Service, the Recreation Opportunity Spectrum (ROS) classifies land into categories based on the probable recreation experiences it affords. This 30-m raster dataset adapts the Forest Service method to fit the landscape and local data in Pennsylvania. ROS classifies land based on land use, a location’s distance from roads, and the amount of human disturbance nearby. These classifications can help determine potential recreation opportunities that lands across the commonwealth can provide. The dataset assigns one of the following values to each cell statewide in Pennsylvania: Urban, Crop, Water, Disturbed, Rural, Front Country, Mid Country, and Back Country.

"Physiographic Provinces 1:100,000
Late in 1994, the Pennsylvania Bureau of Topographic and Geologic Survey was
asked to develop a digital physiographic provinces map at 1:100,000 scale. The
then-available physiographic provinces map was compiled by the Survey at
1:500,000 scale and published at 1:2,000,000 scale in 1989. A new physiographic
provinces map was recompiled on county 1:50,000-scale topographic maps having
20-foot contour intervals. Boundaries based primarily on geology were positioned
using  published geological maps. Most boundaries were positioned by topographic
interpretation. The use of a 20-foot contour interval (a 200-foot interval was
used in 1989) resulted in the repositioning of some boundaries. New
scale-enhanced understanding of topographic/geologic patterns in the Appalachian
Plateaus province resulted in the creation of three new sections and the revision
of other section boundaries. The new compilation was reduced 50 percent and
transferred to 1:100,000-scale mylar base maps. The province and section
boundaries and the late Wisconsinan glacial border were digitized from the
mylars, edgematched, assembled into a single dataset, and attributed with
physiographic province and section names using UNIX-based Arc/Info. The late
Wisconsinan glacial border, which coincides with province and section boundaries
in some places, was copied to a separate dataset and removed from the dataset
containing the province and section boundaries. There are two datasets for the
late Wisconsinan glacial border and the physiographic province and section
boundaries. The original datasets are accurate at 1:100,000 scale. The other
datasets have been generalized to 1:500,000-scale accuracy for more regional
work.
A companion dataset consisting of the state and county boundaries of Pennsylvania
was compiled from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 1:100,000-scale
digital-line-graph (DLG) files for boundaries. The dataset has been attributed
with the county names.

The spatial arrangement of these elevation differences comprises topography.  Topography that has describable uniformity throughout some areal dimension is termed a landform.  Landforms can be classified, boundaries can be drawn, and a map can be created.  A preliminary landform map was compiled at approximately 1:605,500 scale.  The map has four levels of landform subdivision: province, section, region, and district.  These units range in size from many hundreds of square miles (province) to less than 200 square miles (district).  The greatest topographic similarity for a given landform unit occurs in the smallest subdivision (district). The greatest topographic dissimilarity for a given landform unit occurs in the largest subdivision (province).
The landform map was digitized using ARC/INFO software.  Polygon attributes include name of physiographic province, section, district, and area, and the numerical designation of the landform unit.  Arcs were attributed according to whether they form the boundary of one or more of the following: province, section, region, district, or state.
These data sets are preliminary and will be superseded in 1999 by more detailed data sets prepared from 1:50,000-scale compilation maps having five levels of landform subdivision.

The sub-facility types related to the Air Emissions Plant that are included  are: Air Pollution Control Device, Combustion Unit, Fuel Material Location, General Administrative Location, Incinerator, Point of Air Emission, and Process.

Air Pollution Control Device:

Facility that removes one or more pollutants from an exhaust stream. Examples include a baghouse or wet scrubber.

Combustion Unit:

Facility that burns coal, oil, or natural gas. Combustion units are used to produce either electricity, steam, hot gases, or some combination of these. Examples include a utility boiler or gas turbine.

Fuel Material Location:

Facility for storage of fuels shared by multiple combustion units, incinerators, or processes. Examples include oil storage tanks and larger natural gas supply lines.

General Administrative Location:

An administrative location is created automatically for every new air emission plant primary facility. It is used for locational data to represent the entire primary facility, instead of assigning lat/longs to each sub-facility. The General Administrative Location sub-facility may be obsolete in the future, once eFACTS allows locations at the primary level.

Incinerator: 

Facility that destroys solid waste products using a variety of fuels. Examples include municipal waste incinerators and hospital infectious waste incinerators.

Point of Air Emission:

Exact location or structure from which all other air emission plant sub-facilities exhaust their emissions. Examples may include a steel or masonry smokestack; however, a point of air emission may also represent fugitive emissions that escaped from other points of a facility.

Process:

Facility that produces or modifies a product, and creates an air emission from either the materials used or a fuel consumed. Examples include coating lines or cement kilns.

Continuous Emission Monitoring Point:

Devices attached to smokestacks that monitor specific pollutants, i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, etc.

"Ambient and fixed station network groundwater monitoring point data (1985 - 1998)
This coverage represents the point locations and data for 1,106 groundwater
quality monitoring points sampled under the PA DEP Fixed Station
Network (FSN) and Ambient Survey groundwater monitoring program.
Sample data were collected from August 1985 to December 1998.  Monitoring
points were typically homeowner wells, springs, public water supplies, or industrial
wells. Locations were chosen to represent regional background conditions
within a groundwater basin. Samples were collected by prioritized
groundwater basins.  Monitoring points represent some of the top 100
priority basins of the 478 groundwater basins.  Monitoring points were
analyzed for 27 different analytes including pH, alkalinity, total dissolved
solids, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphorus,
total organic carbon, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium,
potassium, chloride, sulfate, silica, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium,
copper, iron, lead, manganese, zinc, mercury, and turbidity.  Data for
alkalinity through silica are in mg/L, whereas values listed for arsenic
through mercury are in ug/L.  Turbidity is in NTUs. PH is a laboratory pH value.
Analyte values listed with the coverage are means.  Monitoring points have been
sampled up to 34 times. Trend analysis results are included for 474 monitoring
points by parameter.  The Kendall Tau rank correlation test was used to test for trends

similar to the standard correlation coefficient to assess the presence of a relationship
between variables. The Kendall Tau value represents a probability that there is a
relationship between two variables. A significance level of .05 was used with the
calculated Kendall Tau correlation coefficients. Trend analysis was performed on
monitoring points using SAS statistical software.

quality monitoring points sampled under the PA DEP Fixed Station
Network (FSN) and Ambient Survey groundwater monitoring program.
Sample data were collected from August 1985 to December 1998.  Monitoring
points were typically homeowner wells, springs, public water supplies, or industrial
wells. Locations were chosen to represent regional background conditions
within a groundwater basin. Samples were collected by prioritized
groundwater basins.  Monitoring points represent some of the top 100
priority basins of the 478 groundwater basins.  Monitoring points were
analyzed for 27 different analytes including pH, alkalinity, total dissolved
solids, ammonia nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, phosphorus,
total organic carbon, total hardness, calcium, magnesium, sodium,
potassium, chloride, sulfate, silica, arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium,
copper, iron, lead, manganese, zinc, mercury, and turbidity.  Data for
alkalinity through silica are in mg/L, whereas values listed for arsenic
through mercury are in ug/L.  Turbidity is in NTUs. PH is a laboratory pH value.
Analyte values listed with the coverage are means.  Monitoring points have been
sampled up to 34 times. Trend analysis results are included for 474 monitoring
points by parameter.  The Kendall Tau rank correlation test was used to test for trends
in ground water quality over time.  This test is a nonparametric procedure that is
similar to the standard correlation coefficient to assess the presence of a relationship

"Coal Mining Operations
Represents the Primary Facility type Coal Mining Operation (CMO) point features.  A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included are: Deep Mine Underground mining of coal. Includes, but is not limited to, portal, tunnel, slope, and drift mines. 
Discharge Point Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. 
Mineral Preparation Plant Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. 
Post Mining Treatment Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment. Untreated discharges that enter clean streams cause acidification, which immediately kills much of the aquatic life. Coal mines that are predicted to have discharges are not permitted; however, coal mining operators are required to treat post-mining discharges in cases where the predictions do not come true. Through advances in predictive science, less than 2 percent of the permits issued today result in a post-mining discharge. New technologies, including alkaline addition and special handling of acid producing material, are being studied in order to help address the remaining 2 percent. 
Refuse Disposal Facility An area used for disposal or storage of waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related materials. 
Refuse Reprocessing Facility at which coal is extracted from waste coal, rock, shale, slate, clay, and other coal mining related material, i.e., coal refuse. 
Surface Mine Surface mining of coal by removing material which lies above the coal seam. Includes, but is not limited to, strip, auger, quarry, dredging, and leaching mines. A Coal Mining Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Mining Program. The sub-facility types related to Coal Mining Operations that are included in eMapPA are:   Coal-Aboveground Storage Tank - aboveground tanks greater than 250 gallons used to store a regulated substance, motor oil or fuel on a coalmine permit. These tanks are regulated under the coal mining regulations since they are specifically exempted from the storage tank regulations.  Discharge Point - Discharge of water from an area as a result of coal mining activities. Mineral Preparation Plant - Facility at which coal is cleaned and processed. Mining Stormwater GP - General permit for Stormwater discharges associated with coal mining activities in which the main pollutant is sediment. Discharge is not into a High Quality or Exceptional Value designated stream.  NPDES Discharge Point - An effluent discharge at a coal mine operation permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System.  Post Mining Treatment - Post-mining discharges are groundwater seeps and flows that occur after a mine has been completed and reclaimed. Many of these discharges have become contaminated by contacting acid producing rock in the mine environment.

"Digitized Mined Areas
Coal mining has occurred in Pennsylvania for over a century. This dataset tries to identify the areas of the various coal seams in Pennsylvania that have been extracted by various underground mining techniques. This information can be used for many environmental related issues, including mine land reclamation and determination of needs for Mine Subsidence Insurance. The information in this dataset was gathered from digitizing the area of extracted coal identified on historic and modern underground mine maps. The maps to these coal mines are stored at many various public and private locations (if they still exist at all) throughout the commonwealth, they have been scanned to create a digital archive, and georeferenced to their approximate location for use in a geographic information system (GIS). The dataset is continuously updated as new maps are processed and is not considered “completed”, i.e. just because an area in Pennsylvania is not identified in this dataset as mined, does not mean the area was not mined.

"Environmental Justice Areas 2005
Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. This is the first decennial census for which the entire United States is covered by census tracts. For the 1990 census, some counties had census tracts and others had block numbering areas (BNAs). In preparation for Census 2000, all BNAs were replaced by census tracts, which may or may not cover the same areas. 
Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. (Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline. 
Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; for example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract. 
Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

"Historic Oil and Gas well locations from Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management PADEP – WPA Mines, K Sheet, H Sheet
These well locations were derived from historical mine maps known as the WPA, Ksheet, and Hsheet collections. These locations are provided for informational purposes only and should not be sole means of decision making and are in no way a substitute for actual on the ground observation. In 1859, the United States’ first commercial oil well was drilled in Venango County, Pennsylvania. In the 150 years subsequent to this, an unknown number of oil and gas wells have been drilled in the state. A current estimate by the Independent Petroleum Association of America places that number at approximately 325,000. Of those 325,000 wells, over 200,000 are still unaccounted for. As these wells are found and verified, they are cataloged in the Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) Abandoned and Orphan Well database to facilitate plugging. There are currently over 8,200 wells listed in this database (2013). With so many unknown oil and gas wells scattered across Pennsylvania and the environmental threats that they pose, identification remains a vital component of DEP’s Oil and Gas Program. Currently, the DEP, Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and geo-referencing. These maps, which vary in age, not only contain information on historic mine locations, but also oil and gas locations. Through collaboration between the Bureau of Mining Programs and the Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management, potential oil and gas well locations were assembled using three mine map collections. These collections include the WPA mine map collection, Ksheets collection, and the Hsheets collection. From these sources, over 30,000 potential historic oil and gas well locations were derived. The Bureau of Oil and Gas Planning and Program Management is constantly looking for historic sources to help locate oil and gas wells in the state that remain unaccounted for. This particular dataset was created using georeferenced mine maps of various/unknown accuracy and various/unknown coordinate systems to various base maps, including but not limited to USGS topographic maps and PAMAP aerial photography. The locations were then digitized using the georeferenced mine maps. These locations are provided for informational purposes only and should not be sole means of decision making and are in no way a substitute for actual field observations.

This is the Department's legacy master stream coverage. The last updates to this layer occurred in late 2004. This layer has been replaced by the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and as such should only be used to aid in identifying legacy stream codes. 

This layer was digitized at a scale of 1/24,000. All streams are connected and have flow direction. Each stream is identified by a unique 5-digit stream code found in the WRDS (Water Resource Data System) field. The streams are further divided into segments. The first stream segment flows from the headwaters to the first tributary. Subsequent segments are tributary to tributary. The final segment flows from the last tributary to the mouth which for purposes of this data layer is defined as the point at which the stream crosses the Pennsylvania boundary. The unique segment identifier is constructed from three concatenated fields. The stream code, downstream river mile, and finally the upstream river mile of the segment boundaries (12345_8.000_ 12.000). The river miles are measured from the mouth, at the Pennsylvania boundary, upstream to the headwaters.

"Industrial Mineral Surface Mine Permits
A layer containing the permit boundaries of Industrial Mineral Surface Mines. Data was converted over from the physical ""Mylar Review"" system for surface mine permit location look-ups. The physical topographic maps and mylar overlays have been scanned, georeferenced, and vectorized to create the permit boundary polygon layers with an index number attribute. The corresponding index cards have been data entered in a spreadsheet. The polygon layers' attribute tables were joined with the spreadsheet. More recent surface mine permit boundaries and attributes were digitized directly as shapefiles. This layer represents a combination of various surface mine permit tracking systems. All future surface mine permit boundaries will be updated here, as the mylar system is phased out.

This layer shows only attaining segments of the Integrated List.  The Streams Integrated List represents stream assessments in an integrated format for the Clean Water Act Section 305(b) reporting and Section 303(d) listing.  Streams are bodies of flowing surface water that collectively form a network that drains a catchment or basin. PA DEP protects 4  stream water uses: aquatic life,   fish consumption, potable water supply, and recreation. The 305(b) layers  represents stream segments that have been evaluated for attainment of those uses. If a stream segment is not attaining any one of its  4 uses, it is considered impaired.  

· Aquatic Life use attainment - The integrity reflected in any component of the biological community. (i.e. fish or fish food organisms)
·  Fish Consumption use attainment  - The risk posed to people by the consumption of aquatic organisms (ex. fish, shellfish, frogs, turtles, crayfish, etc.) 
· Recreational use attainment - The risk associated with human recreation activities in or on a water body. (i.e. exposure to bacteria and other disease causing organisms through water contact recreation like swimming or water skiing)
· Potable Water Supply use attainment - The risk posed to people by the ingestion of drinking water


Segments that have appeared on an approved Category 5 Integrated Listing are the entries labeled as approved. Integrated Lists are submitted for approval every other year. Segments entered subsequent to the latest approved Category 5 listing are labeled tentative. After appearing on an approved listing, the tentative entries move to approved.  The Stream Integrated List is provided as two separate layers determined if the stream is attaining or not attaining its designated uses.

"Land Recycling Cleanup Locations
Land Recycling Cleanup Location

Land Recycling Cleanup Locations (LRCL) are divided into one or more sub-facilities categorized as media: Air, Contained Release or Abandoned Container, Groundwater, Sediment, Soil, Surface Water, and Waste. Media is the environmental resource that is associated with the cleanup effort. The following primary facility kinds describe the Acts from which cleanup locations are derived:

Act2 Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards
The first declaration of Section 102 of the policy provides a brief description of the purpose of Act2: 

The elimination of public health and environmental hazards on existing commercial and industrial land across this Commonwealth is vital to their use and reuse as sources of employment, housing, recreation, and open-space areas. The reuse of industrial land is an important component of a sound land use policy that will help prevent the needless development of prime farmland, open-space areas and natural areas and reduce public costs for installing new water, sewer, and highway infrastructure.

CERCLA Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund
This act was passed by Congress as a federal law in December of 1980, creating a tax on chemical and petroleum industries to: 

Identify and respond to sites from which releases of hazardous substances into the environment have occurred or could potentially occur 
Ensure they are cleaned up by responsible parties or through government funding 
Evaluate damages to natural resources 

HSCA Hazardous Sites Cleanup Act

[This Act] provides the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) with the funding and the authority to conduct cleanup actions at sites where hazardous substances have been released. HSCA also provides DEP with enforcement authorities to force the persons who are responsible for releases of hazardous substances to conduct cleanup actions or to repay public funds spent on a DEP funded cleanup action. HSCA funds are also used to pay the state share of costs of cleanup actions at Pennsylvania sites in the Federal Superfund program. Under the provisions of HSCA, most HSCA sites involve bankrupt facility owners, abandoned facilities, and inappropriate disposal of hazardous substances. As a general rule, HSCA sites do not include active facilities with financially viable owners.

Other
The Other primary facility kind includes a mixture of various different cleanup sites, no further action sites, and potential sites. This is optional data that the regional offices are not required to maintain.

STSP Storage Tank Spill and Prevention Act
Releases and/or ruptures from improperly installed or faulty storage tanks contaminate the Commonwealth's land and water resources. This act was passed to prevent such contamination through ""improved safeguards on the installation and construction of storage tanks.""

"Longwall Mining Panels
Coal mining has occurred in Pennsylvania for over a century.  A method of coal mining known as Longwall Mining has become more prevalent in recent decades.
Longwall mining involves full extraction of the coal seam in the longwall panel. The longwall mining machinery cuts or shears the coal off the face of a long wall panel of coal in a single pass. The machinery will then advance forward and perform another pass along the coal face. The broken off coal is hauled to the surface using conveyor belts. As the machinery advances forward into the coal panel, the mine roof is allowed to collapse behind it. This dataset identifies the footprint of these longwall panels relative to the surface.

"Municipal Waste Operations
A Municipal Waste Operation is a DEP primary facility type related to the Waste Management Municipal Waste Program. The sub-facility types related to Municipal Waste Operations that are included are: Composting:

Includes facilities that use land for processing municipal waste by composting. Composting is a process that biologically decomposes organic waste under controlled anaerobic or aerobic conditions to yield a humus-like product.

Land Application:

Includes facilities that uses agricultural utilization or land reclamation of waste. Sewage sludge is land-applied for its nutrient value or as a soil conditioner.

Landfill - Abandoned:

The Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project collects geospatial and descriptive data for closed and abandoned landfills throughout the state of Pennsylvania. Locations for sites were determined from historic records such as microfiche, index card, topographic map, and staff personal files, and then compiled into site lists. Each of the six DEP regions is staffed with summer interns who physically locate the sites and collect the data for the project.

The purpose of the Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project is to determine the location of abandoned and closed landfills in order to catalog potential environmental hazards. The data is intended for internal government and public consumption, in order to keep property sales, clean-up efforts, and land development well informed.

For metadata on the ALI Project, see Abandoned Landfill Metadata. 

Landfill:

A landfill is a facility that uses land for the disposal of municipal waste.

Processing Facility:

A processing facility is a transfer station, composting facility, resource recovery facility, or a facility that reduces the volume or bulk of municipal waste for offsite reuse.

Resource Recovery:

A resource recovery is a facility that provides for the extraction and utilization of materials or energy from municipal waste. The facility can be a mechanical extraction facility or a combustion facility.

Transfer Station:

A transfer station is a facility that receives and processes or temporarily stores municipal waste at a location other than the generation site. This sub-facility facilitates the transportation or transfer of municipal waste to a processing or disposal facility.

Includes facilities that use land for processing municipal waste by composting. Composting is a process that biologically decomposes organic waste under controlled anaerobic or aerobic conditions to yield a humus-like product.

Land Application:

Includes facilities that uses agricultural utilization or land reclamation of waste. Sewage sludge is land-applied for its nutrient value or as a soil conditioner.

Landfill - Abandoned:

The Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project collects geospatial and descriptive data for closed and abandoned landfills throughout the state of Pennsylvania. Locations for sites were determined from historic records such as microfiche, index card, topographic map, and staff personal files, and then compiled into site lists. Each of the six DEP regions is staffed with summer interns who physically locate the sites and collect the data for the project.

The purpose of the Abandoned Landfill Inventory Project is to determine the location of abandoned and closed landfills in order to catalog potential environmental hazards. The data is intended for internal government and public consumption, in order to keep property sales, clean-up efforts, and land development well informed.

For metadata on the ALI Project, see Abandoned Landfill Metadata. 

Landfill:

A landfill is a facility that uses land for the disposal of municipal waste.

Processing Facility:

A processing facility is a transfer station, composting facility, resource recovery facility, or a facility that reduces the volume or bulk of municipal waste for offsite reuse.

Resource Recovery:

A resource recovery is a facility that provides for the extraction and utilization of materials or energy from municipal waste. The facility can be a mechanical extraction facility or a combustion facility.

"Oil Gas Locations - Conventional Unconventional
The following data set contains all the Oil & Gas Wells in Pennsylvania that the Dept of Enviromental Protection has locational information on.  The wells are broken into two formation types of conventional and unconventional wells.
    A conventional well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of oil or natureal gas from only  conventional formation(s).  A conventional formation is any formation that does not meet the statutory definition of an unconventional formation.
     An unconventional gas well is a bore hole drilled or being drilled for the purpose of or to be used for the production of natural gas from an unconventional formation.  Unconventional formation is a geological shale formation existing below the base of the Elk Sandstone or its geologic equivalent stratigraphic interval where natural gas generally cannot be produced at economic flow rates or in economic volumes except by vertical or horizontal well bores stimulated by hydraulic fracture treatments or by using multilateral well bores or other techniques to expose more of the formation to the well bore.

"Pennsylvania Coastal Zones
The Coastal Zone Boundary delineates Pennsylvania's two coastal zones: the Delaware Estuary Coastal Zone located in southeastern Pennsylvania, and the Lake Erie Coastal Zone located in the northwestern part of the state.  The federal Coastal Zone Management Act (Act) defines the coastal zone as coastal waters and the adjacent shorelands, strongly influenced by each other.  The zone extends inland from the shoreline only to extend necessary to control shorelands, the uses of which have a direct and significant impact on the coastal waters.  The boundary is used as a starting point by persons or agencies to determine if their proposed activities will affect the coastal zones, and are subject to review by the Pennsylvania Coastal Zone Management Program.  Further, local municipalities, authorities, state agencies and certain non-profit organizations within these boundaries are eligible for Coastal Zone grants to support the goals and objectives of the Act at the local and state level.

Federal actions (eg. federal development activities, federal permits and licenses, federal assistance, and Outer Continental Shelf activities) occurring within the coastal boundary, or outside the boundary but impacting upon it, are subject to the federal consistency review requirements of the Act.  In addition, applications for state Department of Environmental Protection permits for activities located in the coastal zones are subject to review and approval by Pennsylvania's CZM Program.

"Pennsylvania DEP Mine Maps
Coal mining has occurred in Pennsylvania for over a century. The maps of these coal mines are stored at various public and private locations (if they still exist at all) throughout the commonwealth. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Office of Active and Abandoned Mine Operations is involved in many projects dealing with historic and active mine map restoration and digitization. The DEP has tried to preserve the historic information contained on these maps by scanning the maps into a digital image. The preferred format for archiving these maps is an uncompressed Tagged Image File Format (.TIF) at 400 DPI resolution and 24-bit RGB color depth. Some archival images are stored at a lower DPI due to scanner limitations and/or extremely large size of the original hardcopy. Various scanners were used at different locations at different times. Detailed metadata on the individual map sheets can be found in the Pennsylvania Historic Underground Mine Map Inventory System (PHUMMIS). Many of the mine map images have been georeferenced after an archive image is made. These maps have been georeferenced to provide the approximate spatial location so that they can be used for many environmental related issues, including mine land reclamation and determination of needs for Mine Subsidence Insurance. It is understood that there is an inherit loss of accuracy in the georeferencing process and the georeferenced map may not align correctly with base maps and/or established coordinate systems. Therefore these georeferenced maps should ONLY be used for reference information only and NOT be used for an engineering and/or human safety related issues. 

Before a map is georeferenced, it is compressed into a MrSID file format using LizardTech’s GeoExpress software. The compressed image is georeferenced in ESRI’s ArcGIS software. An attempt is made to match a minimum of four control points between the source map image and target basemaps/coordinates. The points used to link the mine map to a base map include, but are not limited to: road crossings, monuments, property boundaries, water crossings, structures, coordinates, railroads, etc. When four control points cannot be obtained with this process, additional points may have been used from other previously georeferenced mine maps. Some maps were previously georeferenced in other file formats, if the georeferencing was deemed sufficient, a MrSID image of the same map may have been georeferenced to the previous image using the four corners of the map image. The extents of the georeferenced images are then recorded in a feature class to create a spatial Underground Mine Map Index. 

It should be noted that the “Mine Map Index” overlay displayed on the PA Mine Map Atlas web map application may not contain features for all available georeferenced maps due to duplication of maps and/or visual presentation of the Atlas web map, but the index shapefile available for FTP download from PASDA will contain features for all available quality-controlled georeferenced underground mine maps as of its publish date.

"Stormwater 167
Stormwater management involves the control of water that runs off the surface of the land from rain or melting ice or snow. The volume, or amount of runoff and its rate of runoff, substantially increase as land development occurs. Construction of impervious surfaces, such as roofs and parking lots, and the installation of storm sewer pipes which efficiently collect and discharge runoff, prevent the infiltration of rainfall into the soil. Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as frequent flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration of flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces. The Pennsylvania legislature enacted the Storm Water Management Act (No.167) in 1978 to authorize a program of comprehensive watershed stormwater management which retains local implementation and enforcement of stormwater ordinances similar to local responsibility of administration of subdivision and land development regulations. Under the Act, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) provides grant money to counties to develop stormwater management plans for designated watersheds. This planning effort results in the incorporation of sound engineering standards and criteria into local codes and ordinances to manage runoff from new development in a coordinated, watershed-wide approach. Counties develop stormwater plans for each of their watersheds within their boundaries. DEP develops grant agreements with counties to pay for 75 percent of the cost to prepare the plans. Upon completion of a plan by a county and approval by DEP, municipalities located in the watershed adopt ordinances consistent with the plan. Developers are then required to follow the local drainage regulations that incorporate the standards of the watershed plan when preparing their land development plan. Although not all watersheds have been studied, developers in non-studied areas are still required to follow any local drainage regulations adopted under the Municipalities Planning Code. County boundaries within Pennsylvania as delineated for the PennDOT Type 10 general highway map.

"Stream ReLeaf
The Stream ReLeaf layer represents the locations of projects that restore and maintain riparian buffers along streams, lakes and ponds of the Commonwealth.  A riparian buffer is an area of vegetation that is maintained along the shore of a water body to protect water quality along with stabilizing stream channels and banks. Buffers can reduce the pollutants entering a stream, lake or pond by filtering and altering the form of sediments, nutrients and other chemicals in runoff from surrounding lands. Pennsylvania has the goal of eventually restoring buffers along all of our streams, lakes and ponds. 
The project locations that fall within 150 meters of the National Hydrography Network (NHD) have been snapped to the nearest stream location on the NHDFlowline layer.  All other project locations are plotted as they are entered.

"Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)
The Clean Water Act Section 303(d) establishes the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program. The purpose of the TMDL program is to identify sources of pollution and allocate pollutant loads in places where water quality goals are not being achieved.  This layer shows the list of waters for which technology-based or other required pollution controls are not stringent enough to meet water quality standards.  The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources.
TMDLs can be developed for several categories such as: point sources (permitted sewage and industrial discharges); nonpoint sources (agriculture and urban runoff); lakes; abandoned mine drainage (also called acid mine drainage or AMD); specific bioaccumulative chemicals (PCBs and chlordane that contaminate fish, resulting in fish advisories limiting or banning the number of fish that a person can safely consume); and complex situations (combinations of different types).

This layer shows the list of waters for which technology-based or other required pollution controls are not stringent enough to meet water quality standards.  The TMDLs themselves specify a pollutant budget that must be achieved to meet state water quality standards and allocates pollutant loads among pollution sources in a watershed, e.g., point and nonpoint sources.
This layer represents lakes with TMDL associated with them.  Lakes have characteristics that differentiate TMDLs from other waters. Lakes are not free-flowing like streams, but are contained waters that trap pollutants for long periods. Most lake impairments are from high nutrient or sediment loads. Wherever possible, lake TMDLs are developed with the information in the lake study reports that were sponsored by local watershed groups or other local interests. Target acceptable pollutant loads are set at the level of a watershed largely unaffected by human induced impacts. Load allocations are given to the pollutant sources using the same methods as nonpoint source TMDLs. Other indicators of water quality are also considered in the evaluation of a lake. One indicator is the Trophic Status Index (TSI), which refers to the degree of nutrient enrichment in the lake. Nutrient enrichment causes growths of algae that consume oxygen and interfere with the health of the aquatic organisms in the lake. The TSI is affected by factors such as lake volume, water residence time and nutrient loads to the lake. After target loads are set, the TSI is evaluated under reduced nutrient load conditions to assure that the pollutant reductions will bring the TSI into an acceptable range. Implementation of lake TMDLs is best accomplished though local participation.  This layer is based on the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).

A Water Resource is a DEP primary facility type related to the Water Use Planning Program. The sub-facility types related to Water Resources that are included are:____
Discharge:

A Discharge subfacility type represents the return of water used at a Water Resources primary facility. The subfacility type may be a sewage treatment plant, instream discharge, spray irrigation field, groundwater recharge, on-lot septic or an unidentified facility type.

Ground Water Withdrawal:

A Ground Water subfacility type represents the withdrawal of water used at a Water Resources primary facility. The subfacility type may be a well, spring, quarry, infiltration gallery, deep mine, surface mine or an unidentified facility type.

Interconnection:

An Interconnection subfacility type represents the point of interconnection between Water Resources primary facilities. The subfacility type may be for an interconnection between two public water supply agencies or between a public water supply agency and a commercial or industrial water user.

Storage:

A Storage subfacility type represents the storage of water used at a Water Resources primary facility. The subfacility type represents raw or treated water storage and may be a quarry, standpipe, open off-stream reservoir, closed off-stream reservoir, instream reservoir, hydroelectric dam, natural lake, pond, silt dam, hydroelectric pumped storage or an unidentified facility type.

Surface Water Withdrawal:

A Surface Water subfacility type represents the withdrawal of water used at a Water Resources primary facility. The subfacility type may be an instream diversion, intake from a dam, natural lake, pond, river well, or an unidentified facility type.

Water Allocation:

A Water Allocation subfacility type represents a permit issued for a surface water withdrawal by a Water Resources Public Water Supply (PWS) Agency primary facility. The subfacility type (permit) may be issued for all PWS Water Resources' surface water withdrawals, ground water withdrawals except ground water wells, or interconnections used by a receiving PWS from a surface water PWS.

"Work Projects Administration (WPA) Mine Maps
WPA Mapping was drawn in the 1930’s as part of the “Works Progress Administration”. All mining shown on the WPA Maps is assumed to have taken place ‘Prior to 1935’. The WPA Maps were laid out based on the 15’ USGS Topographic Quadrangles, consisting of nine (9) 5' sections. The lower right corner of the WPA Maps includes the sheet name and coal seam covered by the sheet. The latitude and longitude of each corner of the WPA Map is shown. The adjacent WPA Map is listed at each corner and mid way along each edge. The contour lines on the WPA Maps indicate the elevation of the coal seam in feet “above sea level”. The coal seam outcrop is shown using a heavy black line. The outcrop is the point where the coal seam elevation and the surface elevation are equal. The speckled areas on the maps indicate completely mined out areas. The symbol that looks like a ladder indicates a mined out area where passage ways (""Mains"") were first developed. Clear areas, which are inside the outcrop, were not mined as of 1935. Occasionally mine names and operator names appear around the mined out areas, however clear mine boundaries are not shown. Oil and gas wells are shown on the maps as star-like symbols.

  Dataset Description: The PEMA 0.5-Foot Orthoimagery Delivery (US Survey Feet) project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of imagery data to be collected at a ground sample distance (GSD) of 0.5 foot. Project specifications are based on the American Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) standards. The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD 1983 HARN StatePlane Pennsylvania North FIPS 3701 Feet, Foot US.
 Ground Conditions: Imagery was collected in spring 2022, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the imagery data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS horizontal accuracy guidelines, NV5 Geospatial utilized a total of 119 ground control points to assess the horizontal accuracy of the data.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PEMA_Cycle2_2022.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PEMA_Cycle2_2022.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/download/pema/pema_imagery/cycle2/,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=5177,pasda-5177,"-80.568082493,41.7516673092,-80.5302612099,41.7799829662",unspecified data,Datasets
"Pennsylvania HAZUS - County Summary Reports
In 2006, PEMA completed a statewide study of a 100 year flood event using FEMA's HAZUS-MH risk analysis software.  In 2007, PEMA concluded a broader statewide study using the latest version of HAZUS-MH MR 2.0 that includes damage estimates for 10, 50, 100, 200 and 500 year flood events. The study computed damages in dollars for total economic loss, building and content damage, and other economic impacts. The study also estimated the number of damaged homes and the degree of damage to those homes.
 
With these results, Statewide GIS shapefiles for economic losses and damaged homes were created for each flood scenario using ArcMap 9.1. These files can be displayed using ArcMap 9.0 or higher version - you do not need the HAZUS software to use them. They can be overlaid on other GIS maps (county, local roads, street maps, municipal maps, etc) to show the location and extent of potential flood damages for each of the flood severity levels.
 
The Flood Study maps and information contained in these files can by used local emergency management agencies, GIS and planning departments, watershed organizations, and other interested parties for hazard identification and risk assessment, mitigation planning, and flood response training activities.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: These files are estimates of damages and locations generated by the FEMA HAZUS flood analysis model. These files do not include all possible flood risk areas and are not based on actual past flood events. The data should not be used to determine regulated floodplain areas or the location of individual homes and buildings.
 
The GIS files for the various flood events have been compressed (ZIP files) and can be downloaded from this webpage. The size of the files range from 4 MBs to 25 MBs - download time may be considerable depending on the speed of your Internet connection. Contained in each ZIP file are Pennsylvania Statewide Flood Study ARCGIS shapefiles generated with the HAZUS Multihazard Flood Risk Analysis program.
 
The shapefiles represent all census blocks affected by each flood event. The economic loss layer shows total losses in thousands of dollars. The damaged homes layer shows the number of flood-affected residential structures. Additional information for each layer is contained in its attribute table which can be viewed and edited in ArcMap. The display can also be modified or enhanced by changing the layer's properties in ArcMap (change the display to ""classified"" and the number of classes to ""10,"" for example).

These files can be displayed using ArcMap 9.0 or higher version - you do not need the HAZUS software to use them. They can be overlaid on other GIS maps (county, local roads, street maps, municipal maps, etc) to show the location and extent of potential flood damages for each of the flood severity levels.
 
The Flood Study maps and information contained in these files can by used local emergency management agencies, GIS and planning departments, watershed organizations, and other interested parties for hazard identification and risk assessment, mitigation planning, and flood response training activities.  IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: These files are estimates of damages and locations generated by the FEMA HAZUS flood analysis model. These files do not include all possible flood risk areas and are not based on actual past flood events. The data should not be used to determine regulated floodplain areas or the location of individual homes and buildings.

The shapefiles represent all census blocks affected by each flood event. The economic loss layer shows total losses in thousands of dollars. The damaged homes layer shows the number of flood-affected residential structures. Additional information for each layer is contained in its attribute table which can be viewed and edited in ArcMap.

"Pennsylvania HAZUS - Economic Losses 100yr
In 2006, PEMA completed a statewide study of a 100 year flood event using FEMA's HAZUS-MH risk analysis software.

This means that these waters contain significant portions that are open to public fishing and are stocked with trout. The waters in this layer are lakes (not flowing waters) classified as ""approved trout waters"" and these are open to trout harvest during the ""extended season"" (see Commonwealth Inland Waters). Unlisted tributary streams (those not included in this list of ""approved trout waters"") are not open to harvest of trout during the ""extended season."" Only approved trout waters and all waters downstream of approved trout waters are open during this period. Spearing fish is not permitted in any of these waters at any time of the year. 

These waters are closed to all fishing (including taking of minnows) from March 1 to 8 a.m. on the opening day of the trout season. Some of these waters have been included in the Early Season Trout-Stocked Waters Program and are open from March 1 through March 31. A person shall be deemed to be fishing if he or she has in possession any fishing line, rod, or other device that can be used for fishing while on or in any water or on the banks within 25 feet of any water where fishing is prohibited.

Check with the nearest Fish & Boat Commission office if there is any question about whether or not a water area is ""approved.""

Established in 1969, this option was designed to protect and promote native (brook trout) fisheries, the ecological requirements necessary for natural reproduction of trout and wilderness aesthetics. The superior quality of these watersheds is considered an important part of the overall angling experience on wilderness trout streams. Therefore, all stream sections included in this program qualify for the Exceptional Value (EV) special protected water use classification, which represents the highest protection status provided by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).

"Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas
Part of the Pennsylvania Gap Analysis Project the Breeding Bird Atlas database indicates bird species and nesting behavior of known birds species in Pennsylvania. The database is organized into two primary segments; the block and the species lists (data). Blocks are defined by a code for the USGS topographic map, and the block number. All records are organized by the Atlas region. Various attributes of the Atlas block are incorporated, including geographic features (physiographic locations), effort (hours of fieldwork). The species segment, being replicated the full 320,000 times, was kept to a minimal size, and lists only the species and breeding code, the year and comment. Evidence of birds nesting within an Atlas block was recorded with a set of codes that describe behavior and physical evidence of nesting. These codes are divided into four hierarchical categories, three of which indicate breeding. ""Observed,"" ""Possible,"" ""Probable,"" and ""Confirmed"" breeding codes represent increasing evidence that nesting occurred within the block a species was recorded. ""Probable"" and ""Confirmed"" categories were further segregated into hierarchical codes that represent individual breeding behaviors or physical evidence of nesting. A description of breeding codes may be provided upon request. All of Pennsylvania's 4,928 atlas ""blocks"" were surveyed, with an average of 65 species per block recorded. A total of 188 breeding species were documented statewide. Data catalogued geographically by atlas ""block,"" USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle, county, and physiographic province. Species files include political status designation and a number of life-history characteristics.

"Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas - Second
Twenty years after the first Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania was published, the Second Atlas of Breeding Birds in Pennsylvania brings our knowledge of the state’s bird populations up to date, documenting current distribution and changes in status for nearly two hundred breeding bird species. More than two thousand dedicated birdwatchers completed surveys of birds across the state from 2004 to 2009. The data amassed reveal the distribution of each species and show changes in distribution since the publication of the first Atlas. The core results of the project are the distribution maps. In fact, up to three maps per species show in fine detail the current distribution of all breeding birds based on the second Atlas, changes in distribution since the first Atlas, and, for more than one hundred species, their density across Pennsylvania.The field project was based at Powdermill Nature Reserve, environmental research center of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Rector, Pennsylvania. Bob Mulvihill and Mike Lanzone were project co-coordinators. Following the recommendations of the North American Ornithological Atlas Committee, the basic survey unit was the “block,” defined as one-sixth of a standard U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map, of which 4,937 were identified for survey coverage. Local coordination was provided by volunteer Regional Coordinators, who provided the foundation for organizing fieldwork. Eventually, 83 individuals served as Regional Coordinators (see the list under the Credits tab).Breeding bird atlases employ a set of codes to record the behaviors associated with nesting activity, ranging from the simplest detection by sight or sound, through confirmation of active nests and fledged young. Birds observed in breeding habitat, and within their particular breeding season, were placed in one of four categories based on breeding evidence — observations outside breeding habitat, or Possible, Probable, or Confirmed breeding — with a two-letter code used for confirmed breeding evidence and single letter codes for all other categories (See Project Methods – Breeding Codes). The second Atlas did not recommend undue effort to confirm breeding of common species, because it was believed that the field time could be better spent compiling species lists from multiple blocks. Obtaining confirmed breeding evidence was stressed for species identified in a particular conservation or priority category or for species simply rare or unexpected within the block.

"Allegheny County Land Use/Land Cover 2010
SPC’s Land Use/ Land Cover (LULC) was developed with heads-up digitization methods based on the visual interpretation of SPC’s one-foot resolution black and white orthophotography from 2000-01. Data for Lawrence County was initially digitized using 1997 one-foot by two-foot resolution orthophotography, and was updated with 2000 LandSAT panchromatic satellite imagery. Westmoreland County was digitized using 2003 one-foot resolution orthophotography. In 2006, the SPC LULC was updated based on color aerial photography from the PA DCNR’s PAMAP Program. As a follow up to the land cover developed by SPC in 2000, the 2006 land cover data uses the same classification system and land cover definitions allowing change to be measured across the region. The classification closely resembles USGS Anderson Level I & II standards. SPC’s LULC was updated once again in 2010 based on the aerial imagery collected by the National Agricultural Imagery Program with one-meter resolution. Heads up digitization methods were again applied based on previously adopted definitions set in 2000. SPC’s LULC is designated based on a three-tier hierarchical classification system. Level I contains six LULC types: Urban-Built-Up, Agricultural, Rangeland, Forest, Water, and Barren Land. Levels II and III provide a more thorough classification of the land. Level III classes will be highlighted briefly following Level II definitions. Some Level III classes have been developed consistent with Level II detail for mapping efficiency in accordance with the level of detail and purpose of this project. Other Level III classes have been developed providing higher detail but are not fully utilized so that future mapping can be achieved (at that level of detail) if the need should arise.

"Washington County Land Use/Land Cover 2010
SPC’s Land Use/ Land Cover (LULC) was developed with heads-up digitization methods based on the visual interpretation of SPC’s one-foot resolution black and white orthophotography from 2000-01. Data for Lawrence County was initially digitized using 1997 one-foot by two-foot resolution orthophotography, and was updated with 2000 LandSAT panchromatic satellite imagery. Westmoreland County was digitized using 2003 one-foot resolution orthophotography. In 2006, the SPC LULC was updated based on color aerial photography from the PA DCNR’s PAMAP Program. As a follow up to the land cover developed by SPC in 2000, the 2006 land cover data uses the same classification system and land cover definitions allowing change to be measured across the region. The classification closely resembles USGS Anderson Level I & II standards. SPC’s LULC was updated once again in 2010 based on the aerial imagery collected by the National Agricultural Imagery Program with one-meter resolution. Heads up digitization methods were again applied based on previously adopted definitions set in 2000. SPC’s LULC is designated based on a three-tier hierarchical classification system. Level I contains six LULC types: Urban-Built-Up, Agricultural, Rangeland, Forest, Water, and Barren Land. Levels II and III provide a more thorough classification of the land. Level III classes will be highlighted briefly following Level II definitions. Some Level III classes have been developed consistent with Level II detail for mapping efficiency in accordance with the level of detail and purpose of this project. Other Level III classes have been developed providing higher detail but are not fully utilized so that future mapping can be achieved (at that level of detail) if the need should arise.

"State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) Database for the Susquehanna River Basin
This dataset is a digital general soil association
map for the Susquehanna River Basin (2006 boundary) developed by the 
National Cooperative Soil Survey.  It
consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas
that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that
can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped.  The soil
maps for STATSGO are compiled by generalizing more detailed
soil survey maps.  Where more detailed soil survey maps are
not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and
climate are assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing
Satellite (LANDSAT) images.  Soils of like areas are studied,
and the probable classification and extent of the soils are
determined.

Map unit composition for a STATSGO map is determined by
transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and
expanding the data statistically to characterize the whole map
unit.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data.  The map data are collected in 1-
by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged and
distributed as statewide coverages.  The soil map units are
linked to attributes in the Map Unit Interpretations Record
relational data base which gives the proportionate extent of
the component soils and their properties.

The TWI rasters were derived from 2015 LiDAR for Lancaster and York Counties and 2006-08 LiDAR for Adams and Franklin Counties. The TauDEM extension (D-Infinity tools) for ArcMap was used to create flow direction, slope, and contributing area rasters. TWI was then calculated using the following equation: Ln (Contributing Area/Slope). The methodology was described by Cody Fink in his 2013 thesis entitled Dynamic Soil Property Change in Response to Natural Gas Development in Pennsylvania. TWI results in a dimensionless raster and should be displayed using a red (low values representing no flow) to blue (high, representing high probability flowpaths) color gradient. TWI results vary depending on raster size and analysis options so value thresholds for probability-based overland flowpaths for water should be field verified.

"Bluff Crest shapefile for the Pennsylvania Lake Erie shoreline 2007
The goal of this project is to apply the latest in remote sensing technology to map the Lake Erie shoreline in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania has 77 miles of Lake Erie shoreline contanined entirely within Erie County. Most of the shoreline consists of bluff geomorphologies ranging in height from 5 to 180 feet above the lake level. A bluff is a high bank or bold headland with a broad precipitous cliff face overlooking a lake or sea. Notable exceptions include the mouths of major tributaries and Presque Isle, adjacent to the City of Erie. Nearly all of the shoreline is designated as Bluff Recession Hazard Areas (BRHA) under the framework established in the Bluff Recession and Setback Act (the Act) and companion regulations in Pa. Code Title 25, Chapter 85. Municipalities having BRHAs designated within their jurisdictions are required to enact specific setback ordinances relating to construction and development activities occurring within the BRHAs.The bluff crest is the edge of the bluff.

"Cambria County PA 2001 Aerial Photos
The aerial photos were captured in the Spring 2001 by LR Kimball Aerial Photography for Cambria County. These photos were given to the Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps and Geospatial Information in 2017. The 1414 photos were flown at four different scales (1:500, 1:600, 1:1000, 1:2000) with varied coverage areas of Cambria County. These were scanned at 800dpi on an Epson Expression 11000 scanner by the Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps and Geospatial Information staff. This collection lacked an index. To generate approximate center points, photos were aligned and georeferenced in three dimensions using Agisoft Metashape and using a minimum number of ground control points, typically between 5 and 12 depending on the size of the project. Estimates of each camera pose, including geographic coordinates, were then exported to create a digital index for the collection. This digital index is intended to facilitate discovery and access, but not for research purposes.

A hydrologic unit can accept surface water directly from upstream drainage areas, and indirectly from associated surface areas such as remnant, non-contributing, and diversions to form a drainage area with single or multiple outlet points.

completed by Law Environmental, Inc. on the statewide low-level radioactive
waste siting project, DEP received two coverages depicting river and

data sets, there were many areas throughout the state in which floodplains
were not digitized. The primary purpose of this task was to complete the

Historical markers at the University Park campus and other Penn State locations across the Commonwealth call attention to the University's rich tradition of achievement in higher education and in service to society. A formal series of blue-and-white markers was launched in 1989 by the Penn State Alumni Association and the Office of Strategic Communications. The Alumni Association funds the project while the Strategic Communications office provides management services and coordinates the installation and maintenance of the markers with the Office of Physical Plant. The markers in general commemorate events and locations of broad importance to the intellectual and scientific development of Penn State as one of America's leading public universities.

"Lake Erie Watershed - Erie PA, Impervious Surfaces Mapping
Impervious surfaces data is used for modelling the sources and amount run-off into Lake Erie. Woolpert's automated land cover feature extraction processes was used to perform impervious surface delineation. Woolpert utilized commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) remote sensing software, proprietary software and applications to perform automated feature analysis incorporating imagery, LiDAR and other ancillary vector data. The automated processes replace the need to manually digitize features.

2012 Lake Erie Drainage Area (Erie, PA) Digital Orthoimagery/LiDAR Project - In the fall of 2012, Woolpert obtained new aerial LiDAR covering the entire project area (512 square miles). The aerial LiDAR was acquired at a point density average of 1-meter with final products comprised of LAS (ground and above ground points). The aerial LiDAR was collected during leaf-off conditions during the fall 2012 flying season (November). The LiDAR is being delivered as a project area wide dataset, consisting of 2,500' x 2,500' tiles (which matches the ortho tiling system). Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 30 percent. LiDAR was collected with Leica ALS LiDAR Systems. The file naming convention is as follows: xxxyyy (Pennsylvania North Zone); Please note that xxx and yyy represent the easting and northing coordinates (respectively) in state plane feet. Each LiDAR file is approximately 40 megabytes in size. Ownership of the data products resides with Penn State and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The LiDAR data will be utilized for the rectification of aerial imagery to produce 1”=100’ scale ortho-imagery with a 6-inch pixel resolution. The LiDAR data will also be used as a component during the future delineation of project area wide impervious surfaces (using remote sensing techniques).

The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 2.5' pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, 8-bit intensity images, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. To better understand one of the state’s most vital natural resources and accurately plan for the future, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), through grant funding provided to the Pennsylvania Sea Grant (PASG) College Program, partnered with Woolpert to acquire imagery and lidar data for the entire Pennsylvania Lake Erie Watershed and all 77 miles of shoreline. - See more at: http://www.xyht.com/aerialuas/heights-april-2017-mapping-the-pennsylvania-lake-erie-watershed/#sthash.n3pVphR6.dpuf

A Level 1 Landscape Assessment using spatial analysis was conducted to characterize all mapped wetlands from the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, USA. Wetland sites, comprising more than 168,000 polygons, were defined as 1-km radius landscape circles around the center point of each wetland polygon. Landscape composition was summarized by extracting information of a set of patches of the same type (i.e., a NLCD land use class) within each circle. The following NLCD land use classes were studied: (1) water, (2) developed, open space, (3) developed, low intensity, (4) developed, medium intensity, (5) developed, high intensity, (6) barren, rock/clay/sand, (7) forest, (8) shrub, scrub, (9) pasture, hay, (10) cultivated crops, and (11) wetlands. In addition, four indicators of human activity -Total Core Area Index, Road Density, Landscape Development Intensity Index, and Impervious Surface- were quantified by integrating land cover and road network information.

"PA Explorer: Terrabyte Image
The Terrabyte images are extractives from Landsat Thematic Mapper images through the SpectraPlex process.  This process does not permit the full restoration of the original scene.  The SpectraPlex process takes multiple bands of original image data and compresses them to 255 cluster units using isodata as a cluster mechanism.  The result of the process is an image layer of cluster numbers with an accompanying table of band means by cluster number.
Color rendition:  the shade set is LANDSCOP Portrayal (landscape directed spectral composite portrayal).  Total of the visible bands is blue, total of the infrared bands is green, total of all bands modified to help distinguish conifers is red.
The images have been converted to ArcInfo Grid coverages, exported and transferred to compact disk. The original SpectraPlex images are approximately 54 megabytes and extend over the Pennsylvania borders. The images on the Terrabyte Images cd-rom have been clipped to the borders of Pennsylvania and cut by county in Pennsylvania.

"PAMAP Program Land Cover for Pennsylvania, 2005
The 2005 land cover for Pennsylvania was created through a mix of
interpretation of remotely sensed data and use of ancillary data sources.
The date actually is a mid-point as the remotely sensed and ancillary data
are representative of the time period 2003-2007.

The coding is based on the Anderson Land Use/Land Cover system, where the 
more descriptive detail in the category is reflected by a higher code value.
Further the coding is hierarchical so that each group can be related to other
codes within a general category.  For example, in the Anderson system the general 
classification of forest is a 4, a deciduous forest is 41, and so on.  For a 
description of the Anderson system see;

http://landcover.usgs.gov/pdf/anderson.pdf

"Penn State University Park Campus LiDAR - DEM
	LiDAR and related products for the Penn State University Park Campus 2015. In April of 2015 Woolpert obtained new aerial LiDAR covering the entire project area (+/- 45 sq. miles). The aerial LiDAR was collected during leaf-off conditions at a point density average of 0.5-meter with products comprised of LAS (ground and above ground points) and DEM in IMG format (contains ground only points). The LiDAR is delivered using 1,250’ x 1,250' tiles (matches the ortho tiling system). Adjacent flight lines overlap by an average of 25 percent. LiDAR was collected with a Leica ALS70 LiDAR System. The LiDAR data was produced in the Pennsylvania State Plane NAD83 (2011), NAVD 88 in units of Survey Foot.

The aerial photos were captured in the Spring 1949. These photos were given to the Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps and Geospatial Information in 2021. The 177 photos were flown at a 1â€:9600â€™ scale covering portions of Centre County, PA, including the Penn State University Park campus and surrounding towns. These aerial images were obtained from 9""x9"" film roll. This collection lacked an index. To generate approximate center points, photos were aligned and georeferenced in three dimensions using Agisoft Metashape and using a minimum number of ground control points, typically between 5 and 12 depending on the size of the project. Estimates of each camera pose, including geographic coordinates, were then exported to create a digital index for the collection. This digital index is intended to facilitate discovery and access, but not for research purposes.

"Pennsylvania Geomorphon Landform Maps 2021
Geomorphons (geomorphologic phonotypes) are landforms computed from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition and the concept of computer line of sight (Jasiewicz and Stepinski 2013). The geomorphon algorithm was executed using an open source package, r.geomorphon, under the GRASS GIS environment. The final product includes 10 most common landforms: flat (FL - 1), peak (PK- 2), ridge (RI - 3), shoulder (SH - 4), spur (SP - 5), slope (SL -6), hollow (HL - 7), footslope (FS - 8), valley (VL - 9), and pit (PT - 10). The county level 3-m LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) DEM produced by the PAMAP Program was used for geomorphon calculations. This dataset consists of two sets of geomorphon maps for all 67 counties of Pennsylvania. The first set of maps are geomorphons calculated using the default parameters (i.e. OR = 200 m, IR = 20 m, FT = 1, and FD = 0) adapted from the Chesapeake Conservancy (Baker et al. 2018). The second set of maps are geomorphons calculated using a dynamic zone-parameterization system (i.e. OR = ORzone, IR = 20 m, FT = 1, and FD = 0) based on zones and the average-valley-width (AVW) at drainage area of 26 km2 of each county. The ORs are 200m, 2*AVW, and 4*AVW for zones of headwater, large-valley, and extra-large-valley, respectively. The project was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) through its Water Program. August 2021.

"PSU DEP Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
GIS raster datasets displaying Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) for Pennsylvania by County. TWI raster datasets were derived from 2006-2008 LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) elevation points produced by the PAMAP Program. The coordinate system for blocks in the northern half of the state is Pennsylvania State Plane North (datum: NAD83, units: feet); blocks in the southern half are in Pennsylvania State Plane South. Raster spatial resolution is 9.6 ft (approximately 3 m).
The TWI, also called Compound Topographic Index (CTI) or Topographic Convergence Index (TCI), is a hydrological-based topographic index that describes the tendency of a cell or area to accumulate and retain water under steady-state conditions. TWI is defined as Ln(Contributing Area/Slope angle). It balances contributing areas capturing the tendency to receive water versus slope angles capturing the tendency to evacuate water. An automated procedure was developed in ArcMap® for the TWI computation. Contributing areas (i.e. cumulative contributing area per unit contour length) were determined based on the D-Infinity model proposed by Tarboton, D. (1997). Lengths were measured considering cell size and whether the direction is adjacent or diagonal. Land surface slope was computed using the Horn’s method. 
The project was funded by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) through its Water Program. August 2020.

"Riparia Land Cover - Core vs. Edge forest interpretation 1992
Based on Robbins et al., (1989) and Debinski & Holt, (2000) as well as long conversations with PA wildlife experts 100 meters was established as the distance into a forest that edge effects would influence the health of a forest.  Many forest species are influenced by disturbance and either avoid or are less successful in edge forest areas.    
To create this layer the land cover layer was reclassed to isolate forest classes (deciduous forest, mixed forest and coniferous forest) as well as wetlands into one Forest/Natural class and the remaining disturbed classes (urban, suburban, transitional and annual & perennial herbaceous).  At this stage, wildlife experts were not convinced that road footprints were captured appropriately since the land cover missed most state and local roads.  PennDOT roads (1996) were used to “burn in” or force the roads into the land cover layer.  Once complete a distance function was used to isolate the first 100 meters into any forest as edge forest.  The last step isolated the water class from the original land cover and ensured that it remained in the final core forest layer.  The resulting raster layer has four classes: Core Forest, Edge Forest, Not Forest and Water.

"Riparia Land Cover - Full Land Cover classification 1992
Originally created for the Pennsylvania Gap Project (Myers et al., 2000) land cover classification and interpretation was completed specifically for Pennsylvania to facilitate potential habitat modeling for all vertebrate species reported to breed within Pennsylvania following a modified Anderson Level 2 system (Anderson et al., 1976).  The “Stratification” was our attempt to further classify suburban and urban areas by delineating based on urban reflectance from satellite imagery and road pattern from PennDOT roads (1994).  The result allowed us to identify modified land covers such as forested or herbaceous suburban and forested or herbaceous urban hoping to use these to better capture areas as wildlife habitat for more generalist species.

"Riparia Land Cover - Reclassed to facilitate habitat condition and water quality analyses 1992
Many land cover interpretations strive for an Anderson Level 2 (Anderson et al., 1976) classification.  The important distinction splits Anderson Level 1 cover types such as Forest and Agriculture into more specific cover types such as Deciduous or Coniferous Forest and Row Crops or Pasture.  These divisions provide more information when a modeling effort studies wildlife that favor specific forest types (Mahan et al., 2010) and agricultural models to predict watershed condition (Brooks et al., 2002).  While this level of detail is beneficial in these instances many studies seek to model ecological condition where too much detail become challenging to understand.  When ecological condition is the goal detailed classifications can produce confusing results, thus, it is common practice to reclassify the original land cover to better target a specified project goal.  This version of LCSTRAT1992 targeted forest, suburban and urban classes as import groupings and kept the distinction between pasture and row crop.  Several ecological condition projects used this layer as coarse scale step and then compared these results with site level data collected in the field.

"2015 Cartographic Boundary File, State-County-Census Tract for Pennsylvania, 1:500,000
he 2015 cartographic boundary shapefiles are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). These boundary files are specifically designed for small-scale thematic mapping. When possible, generalization is performed with the intent to maintain the hierarchical relationships among geographies and to maintain the alignment of geographies within a file set for a given year. Geographic areas may not align with the same areas from another year. Some geographies are available as nation-based files while others are available only as state-based files.

Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity, and were defined by local participants as part of the 2010 Census Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated the census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where all the potential participants declined to participate.  The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of census data and comparison back to previous decennial censuses.  Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people.  When first delineated, census tracts were designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions.  The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement.  Physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new development, and so forth, may require boundary revisions.  In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth, or combined as a result of substantial population decline.  Census tract boundaries generally follow visible and identifiable features.  They may follow legal boundaries such as minor civil division (MCD) or incorporated place boundaries in some states and situations to allow for census tract-to-governmental unit relationships where the governmental boundaries tend to remain unchanged between censuses.  State and county boundaries always are census tract boundaries in the standard census geographic hierarchy.  In a few rare instances, a census tract may consist of noncontiguous areas.  These noncontiguous areas may occur where the census tracts are coextensive with all or parts of legal entities that are themselves noncontiguous.  For the 2010 Census, the census tract code range of 9400 through 9499 was enforced for census tracts that include a majority American Indian population according to Census 2000 data and/or their area was primarily covered by federally recognized American Indian reservations and/or off-reservation trust lands; the code range 9800 through 9899 was enforced for those census tracts that contained little or no population and represented a relatively large special land use area such as a National Park, military installation, or a business/industrial park; and the code range 9900 through 9998 was enforced for those census tracts that contained only water area, no land area.

The TIGER/Line Files are shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) that are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB).  The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation.  The primary legal divisions of most States are termed counties.  In Louisiana, these divisions are known as parishes.  In Alaska, which has no counties, the equivalent entities are the organized boroughs, city and boroughs, and municipalities, and for the unorganized area, census areas.  The latter are delineated cooperatively for statistical purposes by the State of Alaska and the Census Bureau.  In four States (Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia), there are one or more incorporated places that are independent of any county organization and thus constitute primary divisions of their States.  These incorporated places are known as independent cities and are treated as equivalent entities for purposes of data presentation.  The District of Columbia and Guam have no primary divisions, and each area is considered an equivalent entity for purposes of data presentation.  The Census Bureau treats the following entities as equivalents of counties for purposes of data presentation: Municipios in Puerto Rico, Districts and Islands in American Samoa, Municipalities in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Islands in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  The entire area of the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Island Areas is covered by counties or equivalent entities.  The 2010 Census boundaries for counties and equivalent entities are as of January 1, 2010, primarily as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National

maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

The EBTJV is focused on an effort to protect, restore, and enhance brook trout populations throughout the historic range of the Eastern brook trout.  One of the goals of the EBTJV was to produce a subwatershed dataset indicating the current distribution of brook trout populations and their perturbations.  This data will aid in quantifying problems, identifying information gaps, and setting restoration priorities.

"Armstrong County soils
This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most
detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National
Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing
maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base
and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely
sensed and other information.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

"Delaware Cropland Data Layer (CDL) - raster 1:100,000
The USDA-NASS 2002 Delaware Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Delaware

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis. The website below provides information and examples of all publicly available Cropland Data Layers:  http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm

groups of related climates and which are differentiated based on
precipitation and temperature.  Divisions represent the climates within
domains and are differentiated based on precipitation levels and patterns
as well as temperature.  Divisions are subdivided into provinces, which
are differentiated based on vegetation or other natural land covers.  The
finest level of detail is described by subregions, called sections, which
are subdivisions of provinces based on terrain features.  Also identified
are mountainous areas that exhibit different ecological zones based on

In the NHAP program, black-and-white and color-infrared aerial photographs were obtained on 9-inch film from an altitude of 40,000 feet above mean terrain elevation and are centered over USGS 7.5-minute quadrangles. The color-infrared photographs are at a scale of 1:58,000 (1 inch equals about .9 miles). All NHAP flights were flown in a North to South direction. These photographs are offered as digital images"" (https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nhap-national-high-altitude-aerial-photography-1980-1989 , April 2017). In 2016, Donald W. Hamer Center for Maps & Geospatial Information at The Pennsylvania State University obtained high quality digital images of 9x9 film from USDA - FSA Aerial Photography Field Office (APFO). Digital images were captured at 2,032 dpi with Wehrli and Associates, Inc. RM-6 and RM-3 photogrammetric scanners. The complete collection of 2,607 images contain 60% forward and 30% side to side overlapping coverage for all of Pennsylvania.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

"Maryland Cropland Data Layer (CDL) - raster 1:100,000
The USDA-NASS 2002 Maryland Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Maryland

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis. The website below provides information and examples of all publicly available Cropland Data Layers:  http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm

sides.  NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate
system using NAD83.  NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10%
cloud cover per tile.
This file was generated by compressing NAIP quarter quadrangle

"National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) 2019 for Pennsylvania 
This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are, increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files. The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year refresh of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.

imagery rectified to a horizontal accuracy of within +/- 5
meters of reference digital ortho quarter quads (DOQQ's) from
the National Digital Ortho Program (NDOP) or from the
National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP); 1 meter GSD ortho
imagery rectified to within +/- 6 meters to true ground.
The tiling format of NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75'
quarter quadrangle with a 300 meter buffer on all four sides.
NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system
using NAD83.  NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud
cover per tile.  This file was generated by compressing NAIP
quarter quadrangle tiles that cover a county.  Two types of
compression may be used for 2008 NAIP imagery: MrSID and JPEG
2000. Target values for the compression ratio are (15:1).

"New Jersey Cropland Data Layer (CDL) - raster 1:100,000
The USDA-NASS 2002 New Jersey Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of New Jersey

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis. The website below provides information and examples of all publicly available Cropland Data Layers:  http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm

management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer. The CDL has a ground resolution of 30 meters. The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor, Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) DEIMOS-1 and UK2 sensors collected during the current growing season. Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the classification. These additional sources can include the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED), the imperviousness and canopy data layers from the USGS National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD 2006), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 meter 16 day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites. Agricultural training and validation data are derived from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) Program. The NLCD 2006 is used as non-agricultural training and validation data. Please refer to the 'Supplemental_Information' Section of this metadata file for a complete list of all imagery, ancillary data, and training/validation data used to generate this state's CDL. The strength and emphasis of the CDL is agricultural land cover. Please note that no farmer reported data are derivable from the Cropland Data Layer.

The USDA, NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, crop-specific land cover data layer. The CDL has a ground resolution of 30 meters. The CDL is produced using satellite imagery from the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS sensor, Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor, and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) DEIMOS-1 and UK2 sensors collected during the current growing season. Some CDL states used additional satellite imagery and ancillary inputs to supplement and improve the classification. These additional sources can include the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Elevation Dataset (NED), the imperviousness and canopy data layers from the USGS National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD 2006), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 meter 16 day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) composites. Agricultural training and validation data are derived from the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Common Land Unit (CLU) Program. The NLCD 2006 is used as non-agricultural training and validation data.

This table contains the ratings of perturbations to brook trout populations by subwatershed.  These ratings were designated by biologists taking part in the Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture population assessment.  The Eastern Brook Trout Joint Venture (EBTJV) is a partnership between state and federal agencies, nongovernmental conservation organizations, and academia.  The EBTJV is focused on an effort to protect, restore, and enhance brook trout populations throughout the historic range of the Eastern brook trout.  One of the goals of the EBTJV was to produce a subwatershed dataset indicating the current distribution of brook trout populations and their perturbations.  This data will aid in quantifying problems, identifying information gaps, and setting restoration priorities.  The dataset includes additional information concerning the type and quality of perturbations to brook trout populations.  The subwatershed classifications are based on a combination of quantitative information collected by state agencies and qualitative judgment calls by local experts.

sensed and other information.

This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and
computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area
extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory
of soils and nonsoil areas that normally occur in a repeatable
pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at
the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line
features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features
too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large
enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and
management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System relational database, which gives
the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PA_Soils2022.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PA_Soils2022.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/download/soils/wss_SSA_PA105_soildb_Potter_PA_2003_[2022-09-06].zip,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=1095,pasda-1095,"-80.995628,38.918590,-74.209781,42.706298",unspecified data,Datasets

"Stratification of Delaware
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) area sampling frame is a delineation of all parcels of land for the purpose of later sampling the parcels. The area frame is constructed by visually interpreting satellite imagery to divide a state into homogenous land use areas (strata) based on percent cultivated. The strata are typically defined as low, medium or high percent cultivated, non-agricultural land, urban use, agri-urban, or water. The boundaries of the strata usually follow identifiable features such as roads, railroads and waterways. The strata boundaries do not coincide with any political boundaries, with the exception of state boundaries.

"USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 Pennsylvania Cropland Data Layer
The USDA-NASS 2002, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 Pennsylvania Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Pennsylvania.

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis. The website below provides information and examples of all publicly available Cropland Data Layers:  http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm

"Virginia Cropland Data Layer (CDL) - raster 1:100,000
The USDA-NASS 2002 Virginia Cropland Data Layer (CDL) is a raster, geo-referenced, categorized land cover data layer produced using satellite imagery from the Thematic Mapper (TM) instrument on Landsat 5 and the Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) on Landsat 7. The imagery was collected between April 24, 2002 and September 12, 2002. The approximate scale is 1:100,000 with a ground resolution of 30 meters by 30 meters. The CDL emphasis is on agricultural land cover. The area of coverage is the entire State of Virginia.

      This land cover dataset is part of a one-time series in which ten Mid-Atlantic States were categorized based on the extensive field observations collected during the 2002 annual NASS June Agricultural Survey. No farmer reported data is included or derivable from the Cropland Data Layer. The area of coverage for the 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL includes the entire states of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia. The funding for this project was shared between the USDA-NASS and Towson State University.

      The 2002 Mid-Atlantic CDL is currently a special one-time project. However, the possibility does exist to establish an annual cropland data layer for any state that shows significant interest and can offer an in-state cooperative agreement with another federal, state, local, or university agency or group. If interested, please contact the Section Head of the USDA-NASS Spatial Analysis Research Section at 703/877-8000.

      There are several additional Mid-Western States for which Cropland Data Layers are produced on an annual basis. The website below provides information and examples of all publicly available Cropland Data Layers:  http://www.nass.usda.gov/research/Cropland/SARS1a.htm

"Income and Employment, 1979-1981
This map layer portrays 1979, 1980, and 1981 estimates for total personal
income, per capita personal income, annual number of full-time and part-
time jobs, average wage per job in dollars, population, and per capita
number of jobs, for counties in the United States.

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf
of, the residents of a particular area.  It is calculated as the sum of
wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income
with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental
income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend
income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus
personal contributions for social insurance.

Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of
the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the
county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used
in the computation.

The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all
jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness
service and paid employment of prisoners.  The jobs are counted at equal
weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all
included.  Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included.

Average wage per job is the total wage and salary disbursements divided by
the number of wage and salary jobs in the county.  Wage and salary
disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including
the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses;
and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the
employees of restaurants.  It reflects the amount of payments disbursed,
but not necessarily earned during the year.

Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of
full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident
population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population
estimates were used in the computation.

All dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.

"Income and Employment, 1989-1990
This map layer portrays 1989 and 1990 estimates for total personal
income, per capita personal income, annual number of full-time and part-
time jobs, average wage per job in dollars, population, and per capita
number of jobs, for counties in the United States.

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf
of, the residents of a particular area.  It is calculated as the sum of
wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income
with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental
income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend
income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus
personal contributions for social insurance.

Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of
the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the
county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used
in the computation.

The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all
jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness
service and paid employment of prisoners.  The jobs are counted at equal
weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all
included.  Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included.

Average wage per job is the wage and salary disbursements divided by the
number of wage and salary jobs in the county.  Wage and salary
disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including
the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses;
and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the
employees of restaurants.  It reflects the amount of payments disbursed,
but not necessarily earned during the year.

Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of
full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident
population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population
estimates were used in the computation.

All dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.

"Ecoregions of Pennsylvania Level III
Ecoregions by state were extracted from the seamless national shapefile.  Ecoregions denote areas of general similarity in ecosystems and in the type, quality, and quantity of environmental resources. They are designed to serve as a spatial framework for the research, assessment, management, and monitoring of ecosystems and ecosystem components. These general purpose regions are critical for structuring and implementing ecosystem management strategies across federal agencies, state agencies, and nongovernment organizations that are responsible for different types of resources within the same geographical areas. The approach used to compile this map is based on the premise that ecological regions can be identified through the analysis of patterns of biotic and abiotic phenomena, including geology, physiography, vegetation, climate, soils, land use, wildlife, and hydrology. The relative importance of each characteristic varies from one ecological region to another. A Roman numeral hierarchical scheme has been adopted for different levels for ecological regions. Level I is the coarsest level, dividing North America into 15 ecological regions. Level II divides the continent into 52 regions (Commission for Environmental Cooperation Working Group, 1997). At Level III, the continental United States contains 104 regions whereas the conterminous United States has 84 (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005). Level IV ecoregions are further subdivisions of Level III ecoregions. Methods used to define the ecoregions are explained in Omernik (1995, 2004), Omernik and others (2000), and Gallant and others (1989).

"EPA Map of Radon Zones for Pennsylvania
The purpose of this map is to assist national, state and local organizations to target their resources and to implement radon-resistant building codes.

The Map of Radon Zones was developed in 1993 to identify areas of the U.S. with the potential for elevated indoor radon levels. The map is intended to help governments and other organizations target risk reduction activities and resources. The Map of Radon Zones should not be used to determine if individual homes need to be tested. No matter where you live, test your home for radonâ€”itâ€™s easy and inexpensive. Fix your home if your radon level is 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) or higher. Consider fixing if your level is between 2 and 4 pCi/L.

The Map of Radon Zones was developed using data on indoor radon measurements, geology, aerial radioactivity, soil parameters, and foundation types. EPA recommends that this map be supplemented with any available local data in order to further understand and predict the radon potential for a specific area.

"EPA Renewable Energy Sites
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response (OSWER) Center for Program Analysis (OCPA) is encouraging the reuse of contaminated lands for siting clean and renewable energy facilities. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration's Annual Energy Outlook 2008, by 2030 U.S. electricity production will need to increase by nearly 30 percent to meet growing demand.  Currently, wind, solar and biomass supply 2.3% of our nation's electricity.  While these renewable sources currently make up only a small fraction of energy production, renewable energy production is expected to increase by more than 70% between 2006 and 2030.  Identifying and using land located in areas with high quality renewable energy resource will be an essential component of developing more electricity from renewable energy sources.

"Toxic chemical Release Inventory data for Pennsylvania
This data layer includes point locations for Toxic Chemical Release Inventory (TRI) data from the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Release Inventory System (TRIS) for all States in EPA Region 3 (PA, MD, DE, DC, VA, WV).  This data layer includes yearly information by State about the facilities that report releases and the types of chemicals being released.  TRI includes information from facilities on the amounts of over 300  listed toxic chemicals that the facilities release directly to air, water, or land or that are transported (transferred) off-site.

TRI was mandated by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) which is based on the premise that citizens have a right to know about toxic chemicals in their communities.  TRI's purpose is to encourage planning for response to chemical accidents and to provide the public and government information about possible chemical hazards in communities.

"National Wetlands Inventory for Pennsylvania - line
NWI digital data files are records of wetlands location and
classification as developed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
The classification system was adopted as a national
classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data
Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5
minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric
coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and
wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide
coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii,
Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean.
Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI
maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from
aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to
scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors.
Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily
photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In
general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and
white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative,
with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet
meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared
photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this
photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland
identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps
therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this
mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other
information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department
of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that
may have been produced by state and local governments, and not
rely solely on NWI maps. See section on ""Completeness Report""
for more information. Also see an article in the National
Wetlands Newsletter (March-April 1997; Vol. 19/2, pp. 5-12)
entitled ""NWI Maps: What They Tell Us"" (a free copy of this
article can be ordered from U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
ES-NWI, 300 Westgate Center Drive, Hadley, MA 01035, telephone,

classification as developed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.
The classification system was adopted as a national
classification standard in 1996 by the Federal Geographic Data
Committee. This dataset is one of a series available in 7.5
minute by 7.5 minute blocks containing ground planimetric
coordinates of wetlands point, line, and polygon features and
wetlands attributes. When completed, the series will provide
coverage for all of the contiguous United States, Hawaii,
Alaska, and U.S. protectorates in the Pacific and Caribbean.
Coverage includes both digital data and hardcopy maps. The NWI
maps do not show all wetlands since the maps are derived from
aerial photointerpretation with varying limitations due to
scale, photo quality, inventory techniques, and other factors.
Consequently, the maps tend to show wetlands that are readily
photointerpreted given consideration of photo and map scale. In
general, the older NWI maps prepared from 1970s-era black and
white photography (1:80,000 scale) tend to be very conservative,
with many forested and drier-end emergent wetlands (e.g., wet
meadows) not mapped. Maps derived from color infrared
photography tend to yield more accurate results except when this
photography was captured during a dry year, making wetland
identification equally difficult. Proper use of NWI maps
therefore requires knowledge of the inherent limitations of this
mapping. It is suggested that users also consult other
information to aid in wetland detection, such as U.S. Department
of Agriculture soil survey reports and other wetland maps that
may have been produced by state and local governments, and not
rely solely on NWI maps. See section on ""Completeness Report""

This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of wetlands and deepwater habitats in the conterminous United States.  These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979).  

Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands.  These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters.  Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory.  These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery.     

By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of ""farmed wetlands"" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition.

standard DEM consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a designated
coordinate projection system. The DEM data are stored as a series of
profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each
profile is in regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of
data is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations
ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to
east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A-record),
followed by a series of profile records (B-records) each of which include
a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations
per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record
(C-record).
7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-meter data spacing, cast on Universal Transverse

"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series 1984
To better understand how the land is changing and to relate those changes to water quality trends, the USGS funded the production of a Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series (CBLCD) representing four dates: 1984, 1992, 2001, and 2006. These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976).  The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties.  

The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed.  MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer.  MDA Federal used Classification and Regression Trees to assign land cover classes to 1984, 1992, and 2006 pixels exhibiting significant deviations from their 2001 expected spectral values.  MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. 

Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation.  For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture).  Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture.  

The USGS is in the process of interpreting and publishing statistics on the extent, type, and patterns of land cover change from 1984-2006 in the Bay watershed, major tributaries, and counties. The USGS will also be publishing land change forecasts based on observed trends in the CBLCD. These additional interpretations, statistics, and datasets will be publicly released over the coming year following publication.

MDA Federal used these methods to develop the 1996 and 2005 land cover change datasets for the Mid-Atlantic coastal area funded by NOAA CCAP. 

Land use and land cover interpretations derived from Landsat satellite imagery are based on the sun's reflectance off the land surface, e.g., urban areas have different spectral reflectance characteristics than forests and herbaceous vegetation.  For this reason, the data most accurately represent land cover (e.g., tree canopy) compared with land use or management (e.g., forests and pasture).  Due to similarities in spectral reflectance characteristics, some land use and land cover classes are easily confused with each other. The spectral characteristics of low density residential areas, for example, may closely resemble the characteristics of forests in a neighborhood with mature trees or of cropland or pasture if large residential lots are composed mostly of lawns. Cropland and pasture may also have similar spectral qualities. Therefore, users should be cautioned against evaluating transitions between cropland and pasture based on the CBLCD. Users should be generally confident, however, that the overall spatial patterns of cropland and pasture in the Bay watershed are accurate because the USGS and NOAA used multi-season imagery to create the 2001 base layer and the data compare favorably with county-level cropland and pasture acreage estimates reported in the 2002 U.S. Census of Agriculture.

"Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series 2001
To better understand how the land is changing and to relate those changes to water quality trends, the USGS funded the production of a Chesapeake Bay Watershed Land Cover Data Series (CBLCD) representing four dates: 1984, 1992, 2001, and 2006. These data were produced by MDA Federal Inc., under contract to the USGS and were derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper satellite imagery. Each of the four datasets consists of 16 land use and land cover classes (Anderson, et al., 1976).  The datasets are temporally comparable and encompass the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed and most intersecting counties.  

The 2001 dataset represents the base layer for the Data Series and is composed of NOAA's 2001 Coastal Change Analysis Program (CCAP) dataset in the coastal and northern portion of the watershed coupled with USGS' 2001 National Land Cover Dataset in the western and southwestern portions of the watershed.  MDA Federal's Cross Correlation Analysis (CCA) technique was used to produce updates (yr. 2006) and retrospective updates (yrs. 1984 and 1992) to the base layer. CCA identifies significant spectral changes between image pairs within the range of spectral values for each land cover class identified in the 2001 base layer.

"Delaware River Basin Catchments Based on Strahler Stream Order 1 Determined from a 900-cell Flow Accumulation Raster in Areas Not Covered by NHD Catchments for 8-digit HUC
In 2012, catchments were generated in the Delaware River Basin for 8-digit HUCs in the areas underlain by the Marcellus Shale (all of 02040101, 02040102, 02040103, 02040104; and headwater areas of 02040106 and 02040203) based on the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Strahler first- and second-order streams. There were areas that did not have a catchment generated so another methodology needed to be used in an attempt to fill in the 'gap areas'. A 900-cell, flow accumulation raster generated for the Pennsylvania StreamStats application was used as a surrogate stream layer with the same Strahler ordering system applied to help fill in the 'gap areas'. Points were manually placed at the downstream end of the Strahler Order 1 and 2 reaches using the surrogate streams as a guide. This manual point placement is different from the automated method used to develop the catchments generated from the NHD flowlines. The manual placement of the catchment pour points does not include a point downstream of a confluence, therefore, not as many catchments are generated in the 'gap-area' processing.

"Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived first- and second-order catchments for HUC  02040104
A breakthrough in water resources management occurred in 1961 when President Kennedy and the governors of Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York for the first time signed concurrent compact legislation into law creating a regional body with the force of law to oversee a unified approach to managing a river system without regard to political boundaries. The members of this regional body - the Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) - include the four basin state governors and the Division Engineer, North Atlantic Division, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who serves as the federal representative. Commission programs include water quality protection, water supply allocation, regulatory review (permitting), water conservation initiatives, watershed planning, drought management, flood loss reduction, and recreation. Much of the new drilling interest taking place in northeastern Pennsylvania and southern New York is targeted at reaching the natural gas found in the Marcellus Shale formation, which underlies about 36 percent of the Delaware River Basin. Because the Marcellus Shale is considered a tight geologic formation, natural gas deposits were not previously thought to be practically and economically mineable using traditional techniques. New horizontal drilling and extraction methods, coupled with higher energy costs, have given energy companies reason to take a new interest in mining the natural gas deposits within the Marcellus Shale. In connection with natural gas drilling, the commission has identified three major areas of concern: 1.Gas drilling projects in the Marcellus Shale or other formations may have a substantial effect on the water resources of the basin by reducing the flow in streams and/or aquifers used to supply the significant amounts of fresh water needed in the natural gas mining process. 2.On-site drilling operations may potentially add, discharge or cause the release of pollutants into the ground water or surface water. 3.The recovered ""frac water"" must be treated and disposed of properly. DRBC is identifying methods, geospatial data, and other information to support decision making on how best to oversee the Marcellus Shale drilling in the Delaware River Basin (DRB).

primary digital orthophotoquad (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground
resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75-minutes of latitude
by 3.75-minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal
Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).The geographic extent of
the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quad plus The overedge
ranges a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters
beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner
points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal
matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83
and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation
of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each
line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to
east with the order of the lines from north to south.
The standard, archived digital orthophoto is formatted as
four ASCII header records, followed by a series of 8-bit
binary image data records. The radiometric image
brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels ranging
from 0 to 255. The metadata embedded in the digital
orthophoto contain a wide range of descriptive
information including format source information,
production instrumentation and dates, and data to assist
with displaying and georeferencing the image. 
DOQ images are acquired as a part of the USGS' National Aerial Photography Program (NAPP).
Through NAPP imagery for each state is produced on a 7 year cycle.
 These images are the NAPP III cycle which will run from 1997-2001

"Digital Orthophoto (DOQQ - quarter-quadrangle) for Virginia
Orthophotos combine the image characteristics of a
photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. The
primary digital orthophotoquad (DOQ) is a 1-meter ground
resolution, quarter-quadrangle (3.75-minutes of latitude
by 3.75-minutes of longitude) image cast on the Universal
Transverse Mercator Projection (UTM) on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).The geographic extent of
the DOQ is equivalent to a quarter-quad plus The overedge
ranges a minimum of 50 meters to a maximum of 300 meters
beyond the extremes of the primary and secondary corner
points. The overedge is included to facilitate tonal
matching for mosaicking and for the placement of the NAD83
and secondary datum corner ticks. The normal orientation
of data is by lines (rows) and samples (columns). Each
line contains a series of pixels ordered from west to
east with the order of the lines from north to south.
The standard, archived digital orthophoto is formatted as
four ASCII header records, followed by a series of 8-bit
binary image data records. The radiometric image
brightness values are stored as 256 gray levels ranging
from 0 to 255. The metadata embedded in the digital
orthophoto contain a wide range of descriptive
information including format source information,
production instrumentation and dates, and data to assist
with displaying and georeferencing the image.

"Fault Lines - Topographic Change in Philadelphia, During the Last Century
A scope of work was developed in response to a request by the U. S. Army Corps
of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The request was to perform a topographic
change grid analysis for the Frankford 7.5-minute quadrangle, 1:24,000-scale
topographic map, which includes the Wissinoming neighborhood, and the Germantown 7.5-minute quadrangle, which includes the Logan and Feltonville neighborhoods of the City of Philadelphia. The following tasks were performed under this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in elevation between the modern and historic surveys. Prior to release, the fully documented GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was reviewed for (1) com-pleteness of documentation and for (2) appropriate analysis and discussion of uncertainties.
The following report is in fulfillment of the tasks outlined in this scope of work and was performed by the U. S. Geological Survey for the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District under MIPR agreement number: W25PHS93358288.

"Geologic map - Topographic Change in Philadelphia, During the Last Century
A scope of work was developed in response to a request by the U. S. Army Corps
of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The request was to perform a topographic
change grid analysis for the Frankford 7.5-minute quadrangle, 1:24,000-scale
topographic map, which includes the Wissinoming neighborhood, and the Germantown 7.5-minute quadrangle, which includes the Logan and Feltonville neighborhoods of the City of Philadelphia. The following tasks were performed under this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in elevation between the modern and historic surveys. Prior to release, the fully documented GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was reviewed for (1) com-pleteness of documentation and for (2) appropriate analysis and discussion of uncertainties.
The following report is in fulfillment of the tasks outlined in this scope of work and was performed by the U. S. Geological Survey for the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District under MIPR agreement number: W25PHS93358288.

"Greater Big Sandy Assessment Unit - National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project - Appalachian Basin (067) Quarter-Mile Cells
Cell maps for each oil and gas assessment unit were created by the USGS as a method for illustrating the degree of exploration, type of production, and distribution of production in an assessment unit or province. Each cell represents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells are coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are predominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and gas-producing, dry, or the type of production of the wells located within the cell is unknown. The well information was initially retrieved from the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data on CD-ROM, which is a proprietary, commercial database containing information for most oil and gas wells in the U.S.  Cells were developed as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying proprietary PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data. No proprietary data are displayed or included in the cell maps.  The data from PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were current as of October 2001 when the cell maps were created in 2002.

"Greater Big Sandy Assessment Unit Quarter Mile Cells - National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project - Appalachian Basin Province (067) Assessment Units
The Assessment Unit is the fundamental unit used in the National Assessment Project for the assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources.  The Assessment Unit is defined within the context of the higher-level Total Petroleum System.  The Assessment Unit is shown here as a geographic boundary interpreted, defined, and mapped by the geologist responsible for the province and incorporates a set of known or postulated oil and (or) gas accumulations sharing similar geologic, geographic, and temporal properties within the Total Petroleum System, such as source rock, timing, migration pathways, trapping mechanism, and hydrocarbon type.  The Assessment Unit boundary is defined geologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the Assessment Unit, such as limits of reservoir rock, geologic structures, source rock, and seal lithologies.  The only exceptions to this are Assessment Units that border the Federal-State water boundary.  In these cases, the Federal-State water boundary forms part of the Assessment Unit boundary.

"National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project - Appalachian Basin Province (067) Boundary
The USGS Central Region Energy Team assesses oil and gas resources of the United States.  The onshore and State water areas of the United States comprise 71 provinces.  Within these provinces, Total Petroleum Systems are defined and Assessment Units are defined and assessed.  Each of these provinces is defined geologically, and most province boundaries are defined by major geologic changes.  

The Appalachian Basin Province is located in the eastern United States, encompassing all or parts of the counties in Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. The main population centers within the study area are Birmingham, Alabama; Buffalo, New York; Cleveland, Ohio; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Chattanooga, Tennessee; and Roanoke, Virginia. The main Interstates are I-20, I-24, I-40, I-59, I-64, I-65, I-66, I-70, I-71, I-75, I-76, I-77, I-78, I-79, I-80, I-81, I-83, I-84, I-87, I-88, and I-90. The Ohio, Susquehanna, Allegheny, Tennessee, Coosa, Delaware, New, Potomac, and Scioto Rivers and their tributaries drain the area. The province boundary was drawn to include the geologic structures generally considered to be in or bounding the Appalachian Basin.

"National Elevation Dataset 10 Meter 7.5x7.5 minute quadrangle for Pennsylvania
The U.S. Geological Survey has developed a National Elevation Database (NED).The NED is a seamless mosaic of best-available elevation data. The 7.5-minute elevation data for the conterminous United States are the primary initial source data. In addition to the availability of complete 7.5-minute data, efficient processing methods were developed to filter production artifacts in the existing data, convert to a consistent datum, edge-match, fill slivers of missing data at quadrangle seams, recast the data to a consistent geographic projection and convert all elevation values to decimal meters as a consistent unit of measure.

NED has a resolution of one-third arc-second (approximately 10 meters) for much of the conterminous United States, Hawaii and Puerto Rico in a NAD83 datum. There is a resolution of two arc-seconds for Alaska and the datum is NAD27.

NED at 10 meters is created using the same methods outlined above with the source data being mostly the 10m DEMs. DEMs at 5 meters, 1/3 arc-second, and 1/9 arc-second maps are also used where available. In some cases, the 10m NED is resampled from LIDAR or created using aerial photography.

One of the effects of the NED processing steps is a much-improved base of elevation data for calculating slope and hydrologic derivatives. Artifact removal greatly improves the quality of the slope, shaded-relief, and synthetic drainage information that can be derived from the elevation data.  Geospatial elevation data are used by the scientific and resource management communities for global change research, hydrologic modeling, resource monitoring, mapping, and visualization applications.

NRCS has elected to ONLY serve NED 10 which is 10 meter or better and not NED 10 which was resampled from 30 meter. NRCS also serves the maps in a UTM projection. These two facts differentiate the maps from those served at http://seamless.usgs.gov/.

(Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.)  Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.

"National Land Cover Database (NLCD) - 2001-2019 Change Index PA
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released five National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011, and 2016. The 2016 release saw landcover created for additional years of 2003, 2008, and 2013. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2019. The NLCD 2019 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2019 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2019: continued integration between impervious surface and all landcover products with impervious surface being directly mapped as developed classes in the landcover, a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing based on Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91% accuracy in overall developed. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2019 operational mapping. Questions about the NLCD 2019 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2019 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91% accuracy in overall developed.

Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2019: continued integration between impervious surface and all landcover products with impervious surface being directly mapped as developed classes in the landcover, a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing based on Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91% accuracy in overall developed. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2019 operational mapping. Questions about the NLCD 2019 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2019 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

The NLCD 2019 design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2019 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2019: continued integration between impervious surface and all landcover products with impervious surface being directly mapped as developed classes in the landcover, a streamlined compositing process for assembling and preprocessing based on Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2019 production. The performance of the developed strategies and methods were tested in twenty composite referenced areas throughout the conterminous U.S. An overall accuracy assessment from the 2016 publication give a 91% overall landcover accuracy, with the developed classes also showing a 91% accuracy in overall developed. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2019 operational mapping.

"National Land Cover Database (NLCD) - Tree Canopy Cover PA 2011
The USDA Forest Service (USFS) builds two versions of percent tree canopy cover data, in order to serve needs of multiple user communities. These datasets encompass conterminous United States (CONUS), Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands (PRUSVI). The two versions of data within the v2021-4 TCC product suite include: The initial model outputs referred to as the Science data; And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data. The NLCD product suite includes data for years 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2021. The NCLD data are processed to remove small interannual changes from the annual TCC timeseries, and to mask TCC pixels that are known to be 0 percent TCC, non-tree agriculture, and water. A small interannual change is defined as a TCC change less than an increase or decrease of 10 percent compared to a TCC baseline value established in a prior year. The initial TCC baseline value is the mean of 2008-2010 TCC data. For each year following 2011, on a pixel-wise basis TCC values are updated to a new baseline value if an increase or decrease of 10 percent TCC occurs relative to the 2008-2010 TCC baseline value. If no increase or decrease greater than 10 percent TCC occurs relative to the 2008-2010 baseline, then the 2008-2010 TCC baseline value is caried through to the next year in the timeseries. Pixel values range from 0 to 100 percent. The non-processing area is represented by value 254, and the background is represented by the value 255. The Science and NLCD tree canopy cover data are accessible for multiple user communities, through multiple channels and platforms. For information on the Science data and processing steps see the Science metadata. Information on the NLCD data and processing steps are included here.

"National Land Cover Database (NLCD) - Tree Canopy Cover PA 2015
The USDA Forest Service (USFS) builds two versions of percent tree canopy cover data, in order to serve needs of multiple user communities. These datasets encompass conterminous United States (CONUS), Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands (PRUSVI). The two versions of data within the v2021-4 TCC product suite include: The initial model outputs referred to as the Science data; And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data. The NLCD product suite includes data for years 2011, 2013, 2016, 2019 and 2021. The NCLD data are processed to remove small interannual changes from the annual TCC timeseries, and to mask TCC pixels that are known to be 0 percent TCC, non-tree agriculture, and water. A small interannual change is defined as a TCC change less than an increase or decrease of 10 percent compared to a TCC baseline value established in a prior year. The initial TCC baseline value is the mean of 2008-2010 TCC data. For each year following 2011, on a pixel-wise basis TCC values are updated to a new baseline value if an increase or decrease of 10 percent TCC occurs relative to the 2008-2010 TCC baseline value. If no increase or decrease greater than 10 percent TCC occurs relative to the 2008-2010 baseline, then the 2008-2010 TCC baseline value is caried through to the next year in the timeseries. Pixel values range from 0 to 100 percent. The non-processing area is represented by value 254, and the background is represented by the value 255. The Science and NLCD tree canopy cover data are accessible for multiple user communities, through multiple channels and platforms.

The initial TCC baseline value is the mean of 2008-2010 TCC data. For each year following 2011, on a pixel-wise basis TCC values are updated to a new baseline value if an increase or decrease of 10 percent TCC occurs relative to the 2008-2010 TCC baseline value. If no increase or decrease greater than 10 percent TCC occurs relative to the 2008-2010 baseline, then the 2008-2010 TCC baseline value is caried through to the next year in the timeseries. Pixel values range from 0 to 100 percent. The non-processing area is represented by value 254, and the background is represented by the value 255. The Science and NLCD tree canopy cover data are accessible for multiple user communities, through multiple channels and platforms. For information on the Science data and processing steps see the Science metadata. Information on the NLCD data and processing steps are included here.

These datasets encompass conterminous United States (CONUS), Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands (PRUSVI). The two versions of data within the v2021-4 TCC product suite include: The initial model outputs referred to as the Science data; And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data.

"National Land Cover Database 2001 -  Imperviousness Layer - Southeast
The National Land Cover Database 2001 for mapping zone 47 was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land Cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution.  For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2003) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp.

The NLCD 2001 was created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones.  A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics.  Mapping zone 47 encompasses whole or portions of several states including the states of Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, and Missouri.  Questions about the NLCD mapping zone 47 can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the National Center, EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

"National Land Cover Dataset 1992 - Pennsylvania; Albers GeoTIFF
These data can be used in a geographic information system (GIS) for any
number of purposes such as assessing wildlife habitat, water quality,
pesticide runoff, land use change, etc.  The State data sets are provided
with a 300 meter buffer beyond the State border to facilitate combining
the State files into larger regions.

The user must have a firm understanding of how the datasets were compiled
and the resulting limitations of these data.  The National Land Cover Dataset
was compiled from Landsat satellite TM imagery (circa 1992) with a spatial
resolution of 30 meters and supplemented by various ancillary data (where
available). The analysis and interpretation of the satellite imagery was
conducted using very large, sometimes multi-state image mosaics (i.e. up to 18
Landsat scenes). Using a relatively small number of aerial photographs for
'ground truth', the thematic interpretations were necessarily conducted from a
spatially-broad perspective.  Furthermore, the accuracy assessments (see below)
correspond to 'federal regions' which are groupings of contiguous states.  Thus,
the reliability of the data is greatest at the state or multi-state level. The
statistical accuracy of the data is known only for the region.

Important Caution Advisory

With this in mind, users are cautioned to carefully scrutinize the data to
see if they are of sufficient reliability before attempting to use the
dataset for larger-scale or local analyses.  This evaluation must be made
remembering that the NLCD represents conditions in the early 1990s.

The Pennsylvania portion of the NLCD was created as part of land cover
mapping activities for Federal Region III that includes the States of
Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the
District of Columbia.  The NLCD classification contains 21 different
land cover categories with a spatial resolution of 30 meters.  The NLCD
was produced as a cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) to produce
a consistent, land cover data layer for the conterminous U.S. using
early 1990s Landsat thematic mapper (TM) data purchased by the
Multi-resolution Land Characterization (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC
Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies that produce or use land
cover data.  Partners include the USGS (National Mapping, Biological

"NLCD 2011 Land Cover (2011 Edition, amended 2014) - National Geospatial Data Asset (NGDA) Land Use Land Cover

The National Land Cover Database products are created through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of Federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Forest Service (USDA-FS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  The success of NLCD over nearly two decades is credited to the continuing collaborative spirit of the agencies that make up the MRLC.  NLCD 2011 is the most up-to-date iteration of the National Land Cover Database, the definitive Landsat-based, 30-meter resolution land cover database for the Nation.  The data in NLCD 2011 are completely integrated with NLCD 2001 (2011 Edition, amended 2014) and NLCD 2006 (2011 Edition, amended 2014).  
For NLCD 2011, there are 5 primary data products:  
1) NLCD 2011 Land Cover
2) NLCD 2006/2011 Land Cover Change Pixels labeled with the 2011 land cover class
3) NLCD 2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness
4) NLCD 2006/2011 Percent Developed Imperviousness Change Pixels
5) NLCD 2011 Tree Canopy Cover provided by an MRLC partner - the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center.  
In addition, ancillary metadata includes the NLCD 2011 Path/Row Index shapefile showing the footprint of Landsat scenes and change analysis pairs used to derive 2006/2011 spectral change.  All Landsat scene acquisition dates are included in the shapefile's attribute table.  As part of the NLCD 2011 project, NLCD 2001 and 2006 land cover and impervious data products were revised and reissued (2011 Edition, amended 2014) to provide full compatibility with the new NLCD 2011 products. The 2014 amended version corrects for the over-elimination of small areas of the four developed classes.  
NLCD Tree Canopy Cover was created using MRLC mapping zones from NLCD 2001 (see Tree Canopy Cover metadata for additional detail).  All other NLCD 2011 products were created on a path/row basis and mosaicked to create a seamless national product.  Questions about the NLCD 2011 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2011 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.

"NLCD 2016 Land Cover Conterminous United States
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal agencies, has developed and released four
National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products over the past two decades: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, and 2011.
These products provide spatially explicit and reliable information on the Nation’s land cover and land cover
change. To continue the legacy of NLCD and further establish a long-term monitoring capability for the Nation’s
land resources, the USGS has designed a new generation of NLCD products named NLCD 2016. The NLCD 2016
design aims to provide innovative, consistent, and robust methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land
cover and land cover change database from 2001 to 2016 at 2–3-year intervals. Comprehensive research was
conducted and resulted in developed strategies for NLCD 2016: a streamlined process for assembling and preprocessing
Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary datasets; a multi-source integrated training data development
and decision-tree based land cover classifications; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land
cover change analysis strategy; a hierarchical theme-based post-classification and integration protocol for
generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields biophysical parameters modeling method; and
an automated scripted operational system for the NLCD 2016 production. The performance of the developed
strategies and methods were tested in twenty World Reference System-2 path/row throughout the conterminous
U.S. An overall agreement ranging from 71% to 97% between land cover classification and reference data was
achieved for all tested area and all years. Results from this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive
and highly automated procedure for NLCD 2016 operational mapping.
Questions about the NLCD 2016 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2016 land cover mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov. See included spatial metadata for more details.

"North American Land Cover 30-meter dataset 2020
The 2020 North American Land Cover 30-meter dataset was produced as part of the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS), a trilateral effort between Natural Resources Canada, the United States Geological Survey, and three Mexican organizations including the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía), National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of the Biodiversity (Comisión Nacional Para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), and the National Forestry Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional Forestal). The collaboration is facilitated by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an international organization created by the Canada, Mexico, and United States governments under the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation to promote environmental collaboration between the three countries.The general objective of NALCMS is to devise, through collective effort, a harmonized multi-scale land cover monitoring approach which ensures high accuracy and consistency in monitoring land cover changes at the North American scale and which meets each country’s specific requirements.This 30-meter dataset of North American Land Cover reflects land cover information for 2020 from Mexico and Canada, 2019 over the conterminous United States and 2021 over Alaska. Each country developed its own classification method to identify Land Cover classes and then provided an input layer to produce a continental Land Cover map across North America. Canada, Mexico, and the United States developed their own 30-meter land cover products.The main inputs for image classification were 30-meter Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 1 data in the three countries (Canada, the United States and Mexico). Image selection processes and reduction to specific spectral bands varied among the countries due to study-site-specific requirements. While Canada selected most images from the year 2020 with a few from 2019 and 2021, the Conterminous United States employed mainly images from 2019, while Alaska land cover maps are mainly based on the use of images from 2021. The land cover map for Mexico was based on land cover change detection between 2015 and 2020 Mexico Landsat 8 mosaics.In order to generate a seamless and consistent land cover map of North America, national maps were generated for Canada by the CCRS; for Mexico by CONABIO, INEGI, and CONAFOR; and for the United States by the USGS. Each country chose their own approaches, ancillary data, and land cover mapping methodologies to create national datasets. This North America dataset was produced by combining the national land cover datasets. The integration of the three national products merged four Land Cover map sections, Alaska, Canada, the conterminous United States and Mexico.

"Northwestern Ohio Shale Assessment Unit - National Assessment of Oil and Gas Project - Appalachian Basin Province (067) Assessment Units
The Assessment Unit is the fundamental unit used in the National Assessment Project for the assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources.  The Assessment Unit is defined within the context of the higher-level Total Petroleum System.  The Assessment Unit is shown here as a geographic boundary interpreted, defined, and mapped by the geologist responsible for the province and incorporates a set of known or postulated oil and (or) gas accumulations sharing similar geologic, geographic, and temporal properties within the Total Petroleum System, such as source rock, timing, migration pathways, trapping mechanism, and hydrocarbon type.  The Assessment Unit boundary is defined geologically as the limits of the geologic elements that define the Assessment Unit, such as limits of reservoir rock, geologic structures, source rock, and seal lithologies.  The only exceptions to this are Assessment Units that border the Federal-State water boundary.  In these cases, the Federal-State water boundary forms part of the Assessment Unit boundary.

Cell maps for each oil and gas assessment unit were created by the USGS as a method for illustrating the degree of exploration, type of production, and distribution of production in an assessment unit or province. Each cell represents a quarter-mile square of the land surface, and the cells are coded to represent whether the wells included within the cell are predominantly oil-producing, gas-producing, both oil and gas-producing, dry, or the type of production of the wells located within the cell is unknown. The well information was initially retrieved from the IHS Energy Group, PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data on CD-ROM, which is a proprietary, commercial database containing information for most oil and gas wells in the U.S.  Cells were developed as a graphic solution to overcome the problem of displaying proprietary PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data. No proprietary data are displayed or included in the cell maps.  The data from PI/Dwights PLUS Well Data were current as of October 2001 when the cell maps were created in 2002.

Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the terminology adopted by the USGS to describe terrain elevation data sets in a digital raster form. The standard DEM consists of a regular array of elevations cast on a designated coordinate projection system. The DEM data are stored as a series of profiles in which the spacing of the elevations along and between each profile is in regular whole number intervals. The normal orientation of data is by columns and rows. Each column contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A-record), followed by a series of profile records (B-records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record). 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-meter data spacing, cast on Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection). Provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle without over edge.

"Pennsylvania North Central Lidar 2019 QL1; Breaklines
Breakline data is used to hydroflatten the DEMs created for the Pennsylvania North Central Lidar QL1  project. Breaklines are reviewed against LiDAR intensity imagery to verify completeness of capture. 
       Geographic Extent: 4 counties in Pennsylvania, covering approximately 85 total square miles.
       Dataset Description: The Pennsylvania North Central Lidar QL1  project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.35 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LiDAR Specification, Version 1.3. The data were developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD 1983 StatePlane Pennsylvania North FIPS 3701 Feet, Foot US and vertical datum of NAVD88 GEOID12b, Foot US. LiDAR data were delivered as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files formatted to 95 individual 5,000 ft x 5,000 ft tiles; and as 31 10,000 ft x 10,000 ft tiled intensity imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; Continuous breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format.
       Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring 2019, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 326 ground control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 546 independent accuracy checkpoints, 322 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (322 NVA points), 224 in Tall Weeds categories (224 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.

"Topographic Change - in Philadelphia, During the Last Century
A scope of work was developed in response to a request by the U. S. Army Corps
of Engineers, Philadelphia District. The request was to perform a topographic
change grid analysis for the Frankford 7.5-minute quadrangle, 1:24,000-scale
topographic map, which includes the Wissinoming neighborhood, and the Germantown 7.5-minute quadrangle, which includes the Logan and Feltonville neighborhoods of the City of Philadelphia. The following tasks were performed under this scope of work: A GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was completed and is accompanied by documentation that describes procedures and provides metadata of the informational content of the GIS. A high-resolution global positioning system (GPS) survey was conducted for each topographic quadrangle in order to evaluate and correct systematic discrepancies in elevation between the modern and historic surveys. Prior to release, the fully documented GPS-corrected GIS grid analysis for each quadrangle was reviewed for (1) com-pleteness of documentation and for (2) appropriate analysis and discussion of uncertainties.
The following report is in fulfillment of the tasks outlined in this scope of work and was performed by the U. S. Geological Survey for the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Philadelphia District under MIPR agreement number: W25PHS93358288.

About GeoPDF data files

PDF (Portable Document Format) digital files are now available for US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen.

The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file.

GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar. Users do not have to install this plug-in to view GeoPDF files.

About GeoPDF data files

PDF (Portable Document Format) digital files are now available for US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen.

The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file.

GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar. Users do not have to install this plug-in to view GeoPDF files.

About GeoPDF data files

PDF (Portable Document Format) digital files are now available for US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen.

The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file.

GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar. Users do not have to install this plug-in to view GeoPDF files.

The Dauphin County, PA 2016 QL2 LiDAR project called for the planning, acquisition, processing and derivative products of LIDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania South Zone, US survey feet; NAVD1988 (Geoid 12B), US survey feet. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 711 individual 5,000-foot x 5,000-foot tiles. Tile names use the following naming schema: ""YYYYXXXXPAd"" where YYYY is the first 3 characters of the tile's upper left corner Y-coordinate, XXXX - the first 4 characters of the tile's upper left corner X-coordinate, PA = Pennsylvania, and d = 'N' for North or 'S' for South. Corresponding 2.5-foot gridded hydro-flattened bare earth raster tiled DEM files and intensity image files were created using the same 5,000-foot x 5,000-foot schema. Hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Continuous 2-foot contours were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR collection began in Spring 2016, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 84 control points (24 calibration control points and 60 QC checkpoints). These were used to calibrate the LIDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area.

Continuous breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in fall 2017, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 150 ground control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 245 independent accuracy checkpoints, 142 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (142 NVA points), 103 in Tall Weeds categories (103 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.

"Zebra Mussel Distribution
The concern caused by the explosive spread of the zebra mussel, (Dreissena

        Nonindigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention and Control Act of 1990 (P.L.
        101-646).  The impact of this biofouling pest on the economy and
        ecological processes in the U.S. and Canada has required prompt action on
        a large scale to prevent further infestations and minimize ecological
        degradation.  This map layer is a compilation of reports of confirmed
        zebra mussel sightings in the United States from 1988 to January 2008.
        It provides geographical and historical information to show distribution
        over time.  The reports came from a variety of Federal, State, and
        municipal agencies, public utilities, universities, engineering and
        private consultant firms.  The locations of confirmed sightings were
        registered at 1:100,000-scale on EPA Reach File Version 3.0 and are
        maintained as an ArcInfo export file.  This is a revised version of the

"Flood Inundation Mapping for Susquehanna River in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania - 11-ft to 37-ft
This layer was created as part of a Flood Inundation Map Library developed for display within the NOAA National Weather Service's Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Services (AHPS), the SRBC Susquehanna Inundation Map Viewer (SIMV), and the USGS Flood Inundation Mapper (FIM). This data represents the potential flood extent for a stage of 11-ft to 37-ft as recorded at the Harrisburg (Susquehanna River at Harrisburg, PA; USGS ID 01570500) river gage. This data is part of a series of inundation layers meant to correlate observations and forecasts from the river gage with a visual representation of the areas impacted by high water. The data set of flood inundation areas was created from flood scenarios generated by HEC-RAS runs provided by USACE-Baltimore and LiDAR data from PASDA processed to extract bare earth points. A shapefile of inundation area for each stage was created and subsequently merged to form continuous datasets for the main-stem Susquehanna River and backwater areas on its tributaries.This data was developed to assist the public and emergency officials with planning and response to high water episodes at or near a defined National Weather Service river forecast point.

"Forest Patch Classification, Delaware River Basin, Northern Section, 2010-2011
High resolution land cover dataset for the Delaware River Basin, an area comprised of parts of six counties in the state of New York and four counties in Pennsylvania. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.

Ancillary data sources such as LiDAR-derived breaklines for roads and hydrology were used to augment the land-cover mapping. This land-cover dataset is considered current based on data of acquisition for the leaf-on orthoimagery. Land-cover class assignment was accomplished using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing.

"High-Resolution Land Cover Delaware River Basin - Clipped to Counties
Clipped to Counties - Mapping Area polygon - High resolution land cover dataset for the Delaware River Basin, an area comprised of parts of six counties in the state of New York and four counties in Pennsylvania. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. No accuracy assessment was conducted, but the dataset was subject to a thorough manual quality control.

Twelve land cover classes were mapped:0 - Background1 - Water2 - Emergent Wetlands3 - Tree Canopy4 - Scrub/Shrub5 - Low Vegetation6 - Barren7 - Structures8 - Other Impervious Surfaces9 - Roads10 - Tree Canopy over Structures11 - Tree Canopy over Other Impervious Surfaces12 - Tree Canopy over RoadsThe complete class definitions and standards can be viewed at the link below.http://goo.gl/THacggThe primary sources used to derive this land-cover layer were 2013 leaf-on orthoimagery, 2015 leaf-off orthoimagery, and leaf-off LiDAR acquired across a series of dates during the period 2006-2015. Ancillary data sources such as road centerlines and hydrology were used to augment the land-cover mapping. This land-cover dataset is considered current based on data of acquisition for the leaf-on orthoimagery. Land-cover class assignment was accomplished using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets. Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing. Following the automated OBIA mapping a detailed manual review of the dataset was carried out at a scale of 1:3000 and all observable errors were corrected.This dataset was developed to support land-cover mapping and modeling initiatives in the Delaware River Basin. At the time of its publication, it represented the most accurate and detailed land cover map for the New Jersey portion of the Delaware River Basin.

"Landcover - Delaware River Basin NY and PA
High resolution land cover dataset for the Delaware River Basin, an area comprised of parts of six counties in the state of New York and four counties in Pennsylvania. Seven land cover classes were mapped: (1) tree canopy, (2) grass/shrub, (3) bare earth, (4) water, (5) buildings, (6) roads, and (7) other paved surfaces. The minimum mapping unit for the delineation of features was set at six square meters. The primary sources used to derive this land cover layer were 2008 LiDAR data and 2010 - 2011 NAIP imagery. LiDAR coverage was complete for the Pennsylvaia portion of the AOI, however, LiDAR was unavailable for large portions of the New York portion. Where LiDAR was not available, imagery was the primary data source. Ancillary data sources included GIS data (eg. such as hydrology, breakline and buildings) provided by the counties of Lackawana, Monroe, Pike and Wayne, PA, as well as the New York State GIS Clearinghouse. Some of these vector datasets were edited by the UVM Spatial Analysis lab through manual interpretation. Other datasets, such as bare soil, were created by the UVM Spatial Anyslsis Lab in order to assist in landcover creation. This land cover dataset is considered current for Pennsylvania portion of the study area as of summer 2010. The dataset is current as of summer 2011 for the New York counties of Chenango, Delaware, Orange and Sullivan. Broome County, NY, is considered current as of summer 2010. Ulster County, NY, employed data from both summer 2010 and summer 2011, therefore currentness varies throughout the county.

"Landcover - Tree Canopy Change, Washington DC, 2006 - 2011
Change in the District of Columbia’s tree canopy estimated from 2011 leaf-on imagery and 2006 leaf-on imagery in conjunction with 2008 leaf-off LiDAR. This layer consists of three classes of tree canopy: 1) no change, 2) loss, and 3) gain. No change indicates that the tree canopy has not changed substantially from 2006 to 2011. Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Extensive quality assurance and quality control methods were employed. This dataset has been independently reviewed by two separate organizations.

This layer consists of three classes of tree canopy: 1) no change, 2) loss, and 3) gain. No change indicates that the tree canopy has not changed substantially from 2006 to 2011. Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data. Extensive quality assurance and quality control methods were employed. This dataset has been independently reviewed by two separate organizations.",FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=DC_TreeCanopy_Change_20062011.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=DC_TreeCanopy_Change_20062011.xml,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/download/uvm_spatialanalysislab/DC_TreeCanopy_Change_20062011.zip,https://www.pasda.psu.edu/uci/DataSummary.aspx?dataset=3157,pasda-3157,"-77.119840,38.803099,-76.909012,38.995968",unspecified data,Datasets
"Modeled Primary Wetlands, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Statewide, 2013
This dataset was developed to support land-cover mapping and modeling initiatives in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.


High-resolution wetlands dataset for Pennsylvlania. Primary wetlands classes were mapped, plus water:EmergentScrub\ShrubForestedWaterThe primary sources used to derive this modeled wetlands layer were 2006-2008 leaf-off LiDAR data, 2005-2008 leaf-off orthoimagery, 2013 high-resolution land-cover data, and moderate-resolution predictive wetlands maps incorporating topography, hydrological flow potential, and climate data. This dataset is considered current based on the 2013 land-cover map.Wetlands classes were mapped using a rule-based expert system embedded within an object-based framework. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties. Using this technique, a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process. A series of morphological procedures were used to ensure that the end product was both accurate and cartographically coherent.This dataset was developed to support land-cover mapping and modeling initiatives in Pennsylvania.

About GeoPDF data files

PDF (Portable Document Format) digital files are now available for US Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. Each file is essentially a scan of a topographic map with the added feature of being georegistered. The files can be used as a PDF file, enabling users to view topo maps onscreen.

The GeoPDF format is an extension to Adobe's PDF 1.3 and higher versions enabling GIS functionality within standard PDF files. This format is designed for the efficient distribution and communication of rich spatial data to anyone who needs to view, review, verify, update, or print it. Because GeoPDF files are highly compressed and encapsulated, they are smaller, faster, and easier to transmit than GIS data sets, without the overhead associated with typical GIS spatial data sets (or the management of database tables, external links, and dependencies). Using the GeoPDF format, publishers of spatial data can select the specific spatial data they want recipients to see and can publish GIS source files into a single GeoPDF file.

GeoPDF files are not a replacement for native GIS formats. GIS professionals still need the original files for editing or updating spatial data. GeoPDF files enable non-GIS professionals, field technicians, business executives, and their colleagues to utilize rich spatial information. Users can view and print GeoPDF files with the free and ubiquitous Adobe Reader ,and they can do more with the data using a free plug-in called TerraGo Toolbar. Users do not have to install this plug-in to view GeoPDF files.

Improvements in water quality will also follow from improvements in public policy, which in turn will follow from higher engagement by NGO staff and volunteers in public policy advocacy that is stimulated by the grant-funded work. Purpose: The purpose of this map is to combine multi-state conserved land datasets into a singular form with common attribute fields that follow that of the Protected Areas Database of the United States (PAD-US) for the area that is the Delaware River Basin. Protected land categories follow that of the PA Conserved Lands map. This dataset can be used in the analysis of potential water quality improvements; alternative approaches to stewardship; riparian buffer development; and prioritization of land protection prospects within the Delaware River Watershed.

"NHD Stream Order - Pennsylvania
The National Hydrography Dataset Plus High Resolution (NHDPlus HR) is a geospatial model for the flow of water across the landscape and through the stream network. The dataset is built using data at 1:24,000 scale or better. The dataset expands on the NHD with additional attribute data. This layer uses the NHDPlus HR to create a Pennsylvania-wide Strahler stream order database. The layer includes unique identifiers for stream reaches (Reach Code) to allow joins with other stream datasets built off the NHD. PA Department of Environmental Protection’s non-attaining, impaired, streams layer (202301) was joined in this manner. The Stream Integrated List is provided as two separate layers determined if the stream is attaining or not attaining its designated uses. DEP Streams Integrated List layer is maintained by the PADEP Office of Water Management, Bureau of Water Supply & Wastewater Management, Water Quality Assessment and Standards Division. The layer is based on the High Resolution National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Additional update information is provided by Bureau of Watershed Management, Water Use Planning Division.

"PA Conserved Land - Conservation Easements
The conservation easement is a tool for conserving land in the public interest that doesn’t rely on government regulations and that allows private landowners to maintain ownership and control of their land. A conservation easement is established by mutual agreement between a landowner and a private land trust or government. The easement limits certain uses of the land in order to achieve particular conservation objectives while keeping the land in the owner’s control. The owner may continue to use the land as the owner wishes—within the constraints agreed to when establishing the easement. A conservation easement does not create a right for the public to access a property, unless the owner explicitly establishes that right. The conservation easement, which is an interest in real property, continues in force no matter who owns the land in the future. Practically all conservation easements are designed to be perpetual; for nearly all land trusts and circumstances, this is non-negotiable. For more information, search “Conservation Easement” at https://conservationtools.org/.

"Riparian Planting Prioritization - Points
This dataset identifies and scores potential riparian planting sites across Pennsylvania. Planting sites are based on 100-foot buffers around NHD High Resolution streams, areas, and water bodies. Qualifying areas have at least 0.25 acres of “Low Vegetation” land cover on a single tax parcel. Land cover data came from the 1-m High Resolution Land Cover produced by the Chesapeake Conservancy and University of Vermont. Sites are scored using a 0-3 score that combines Topographic Wetness Index, Sediment Trapping Efficiency, and upslope land cover. This version of the prioritization data converts each planting site polygon to a point. It is best suited for distant, small-scale mapping and analyses.

"County natural heritage inventories
County Natural Heritage Inventories focus on areas that are the best examples of ecological resources in a county. Although agricultural lands and open space may be included as part of inventory areas, the emphasis for the designation and delineation of the areas are the ecological values present. Important selection criteria for Natural Heritage Areas are the existence of habitat for plants and animals of special concern, the existence of uncommon or especially important natural communities, and the size and landscape context of a site containing good quality natural features. Large areas and areas that are minimally disturbed by development provide the backbone that links habitats and allows plants and animals to shift and move across sizable portions of the landscape. The polygons in this layer represent two types of conservation areas. A Biological Diversity Area (BDA) is defined as an area containing plants or animals of special concern at state or federal levels, exemplary natural communities, or exceptional native diversity. BDAs include both the immediate habitat and surrounding lands important in the support of these special elements.  A Landscape Conservation Area (LCA) is defined as an area a large contiguous area that is important because of its size, open space, habitats, and/or inclusion of one or more Biological Diversity Areas. Although an LCA includes a variety of land uses, it typically has not been heavily disturbed and thus retains much of its natural character.

"York County - Natural Areas Inventory
This shapefile contains the Core Habitat of Biological Diversity Areas identified through the County Natural Heritage Inventory program of the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program. County Natural Heritage Inventories focus on areas that are the best examples of ecological resources in a county. Although agricultural lands and open space may be included as part of inventory areas, the emphasis for the designation and delineation of the areas are the ecological values present. Important selection criteria for Natural Heritage Areas are the existence of habitat for plants and animals of special concern, the existence of uncommon or especially important natural communities, and the size and landscape context of a site containing good quality natural features. Large areas and areas that are minimally disturbed by development provide the backbone that links habitats and allows plants and animals to shift and move across sizable portions of the landscape. Core Habitat areas are intended to identify the essential habitat of the species of concern or natural community that can absorb very little activity or disturbance without substantial impact to the natural features. Polygons are based on aerial photo interpretation, field surveys, and existing PNDI data and were delineated by the ecologists on-screen using ArcView (ESRI, Inc., Version 3.3, 8x, and 9x) with the 1:24,000 scale USGS Digital Raster Graphics and/or Digital Aerial Photography images as a background. For each core habitat polygon, the attribute table contains fields indicating the Site Name and Significance. See individual CNHI reports for further information on methodology, site descriptions, and species or communities found at each site.

"York County - Soils
This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. This data set consists of georeferenced digital map data and computerized attribute data. The map data are in a soil survey area extent format and include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. A special soil features layer (point and line features) is optional. This layer displays the location of features too small to delineate at the mapping scale, but they are large enough and contrasting enough to significantly influence use and management. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

"YCPC 2015 Digital Orthoimagery for York County, Pennsylvania
Multi-spectral digital orthophotography was produced at a scale of 1:2400 (1 in = 200 ft) with a 12 inch pixel resolution for the YCPC project area. Digital orthophotography combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map. Orthophoto data is produced through the use of digitized perspective aerial photographs or other remotely sensed image data. This data is processed into a digital product that has been rectified for camera lens distortion, vertical displacement caused by terrain relief, and variations in aircraft altitude and orientation.
