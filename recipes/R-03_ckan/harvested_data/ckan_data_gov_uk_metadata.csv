These maps identify landscape areas based on their lithology. The scale of the maps is 1:250 000 and provides a simplified interpretation of the geology that may be used as a guide at a regional level, but should not be relied on for local geology. Superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time; the Quaternary. These deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock. The superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas with a geological name and their deposit-type or lithological composition. The Superficial map shows the deposits within the extent of the six Counties of Northern Ireland. The Bedrock map comprises the bedrock geology and contains dykes and geological faults. Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy of the rocks. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Dykes defines small, narrow areas of a specific type of bedrock geology; that is igneous rocks which have been intruded into the landscape at a later date than the surrounding bedrock. Geological faults occur where a body of bedrock has been fractured and displaced by large scale processes affecting the earth's crust (tectonic forces). The Bedrock map shows the main bedrock geological divisions in Northern Ireland and coverage extends to the west into the Republic of Ireland. The printed map includes a stratigraphic column. Digital datasets have been derived from the maps and comprise three layers. 1. Superficial polygons, 2. Bedrock polygons and 3. Linear features. Attribute tables describe the polygon features. These data are generalised and superseded by the 1:10k Geological Maps of Northern Ireland.",dataset,,2011-06-03T12:18:16.457506,2025-04-21T15:20:41.199477,False,False,active,,,,,gsni@economy-ni.gov.uk,,,,,,d295fb8a-7be8-4fd1-b4cf-317a18a1e6b9,7ad23da8-c49d-4d81-bf85-5cfab52ba143,,,"Geology, Maps, NERC_DDC, UK Location (INSPIRE)",british-geological-survey,British Geological Survey (BGS),"A world-leading geoscience centre for survey and monitoring; modelling and research; data and knowledge.

The classification ranks land on the basis of its potential productivity and cropping flexibility determined by the extent to which its physical characteristics (soil, climate and relief) impose long term restrictions on its agricultural use.
THE CLASSES
Class 1. Land capable of producing a very wide range of crops with high yields
Class 2. Land capable of producing a wide range of crops with yields less high than Class 1.
Class 3. Land capable of producing good yields from a moderate range of crops.
Class 4. Land capable of producing a narrow range of crops.
Class 5. Land suited only to improved grassland and rough grazing.
Class 6. Land capable only of use as rough grazing.
Class 7. Land of very limited agricultural value.
THE DIVISIONS
A division is a ranking within a class. As the requirements of the crops suited to Classes 1 and 2 are fairly stringent, land in these classes has inherently low degrees of internal variability and no divisions are present. 
The requirements of crops grown in the remaining classes are less rigorous, consequently land included is more variable in character.",dataset,,2018-02-09T02:51:41.349394,2025-03-27T06:05:06.024384,False,False,active,,,,,david.donnelly@hutton.ac.uk,,,,,,431b5956-7b87-41ba-8fc5-a4a8b681b797,c924c995-e063-4f30-bbd3-61418486f0a9,,,"Land use, Soil, agriculture",scottish-government-spatial-data-infrastructure,Scottish Government SpatialData.gov.scot,"SpatialData.gov.scot is Scotland’s catalogue of geospatial data.

     The Marine Algae Recording Scheme was launched by the British Phycological Society in conjunction with the Biological Records Centre (BRC) in 1971. The aim of the scheme, organised by Professor T.A. Norton, was to map the distribution of the British seaweeds. It covers all the benthic members of the Chlorophycota, Phaeophycota and Rhodophycota, plus the genus Vaucheria (Xanthophyta). Only attached seaweeds are recorded, drift plants being ignored as their provenance is unknown. A standard recording card was produced at the start of the scheme, and was used for field recording by an enthusiastic group including both professional phycologists and amateur collectors. In addition, records were extracted from the herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh and from papers published since 1950. The accumulated record cards were passed over to the Biological Records Centre in 1982 and put onto computer in 1983-4. The following data were included for each record (if provided by the original recorder): site name, grid reference (in full), date of record, code number of recorder and source of record.
     A Preliminary Atlas of fifteen species was published by the Biological Records Centre in 1978; since then recording has progressed steadily with a Provisional Atlas of 155 taxa published in 1985 and the final atlas published in 2003.
     Due to the age of some of the records, some of the Latin names have been revised since they were recorded. For those species names that weren't recognised by the current species dictionary the latest synonym has been taken from Hardy, G. and Guiry, M. (2003) A Check-list and Atlas of the Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland. A note to this effect has been written in the notes section of the sample screen.
     N.B. All of the records received from the Biological Records Centre have currently been imported, including those with a vague date or a vague 2 figure grid reference. Where the locality name stated for a record allowed it to be pinpointed to a 4 figure grid reference, this has been done and a note added into the Sample description screen. It is hoped that over the coming years, the original source of most of these records can be identified and any additional information extracted and added to this database to add greater accuracy and value to the records.",dataset,,2024-09-10T08:41:01.957498,2024-09-10T08:41:01.957501,False,False,active,,,,,enquiries@derc.org.uk,,,,,,fe27eda4-4fcf-46e5-8818-5fdb2b0a52f9,c756c8da-f176-4640-950e-9c00b9e404df,,,,marine-environmental-data-information-network,Marine Environmental Data & Information Network,MEDIN is a partnership of UK organisations committed to improving access to marine data.
