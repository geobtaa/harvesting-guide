"Implemented Stormwater Control Measures, ACCD [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center
Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center]","Implemented Stormwater Control Measures, ACCD","Shows the locations of Stormwater Control Measures (SCMs) that were implemented as a condition of National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and Erosion and Sediment Control General Permit (ESCGP) permits within Allegheny County, PA. Specifically, this data set consists of SCMs associated with constructed permits that were terminated by the Allegheny County Conservation District (ACCD). Features were digitized using paper and/or digital as-built plan drawings, where available, received as part of the Notice of Termination (NOT) submission process. SCM data was obtained from submitted NOT forms which are also required as part of this submission. Construction of SCMs are often required by NPDES and ESCGP permits to manage excess stormwater, created by increased impervious area, by treating rate, volume, and/or water quality.",eng,,Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center,Datasets,,ACCD|Allegheny County Conservation District|Chapter 102|Data|Environment|NOT|Notice of Termination|PCSM|Post-Construction Stormwater Management|SCM|Stormwater|Stormwater Control Measures,2023-12-07,Continually updated resource,,Pennsylvania,"-80.5199,39.7198,-74.6895,42.5161",Vector data,Shapefile,http://data.wprdc.org/dataset/implemented-stormwater-control-measures-accd-points,https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/c925a742-96bc-4323-99fd-98ff8d446695/resource/ab2cee7c-8518-4fec-a1bc-e74a3f5f86ca/download/implemented_scms_polygons.zip,,,,,,c925a742-96bc-4323-99fd-98ff8d446695,implemented-stormwater-control-measures-accd-points,Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center Open Data,08f-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,08f-01,Active,CKAN,2024-05-28,,Public,FALSE,FALSE

Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center]","Applications for Development, ACCD","Approved applications for development that were received and reviewed by the Allegheny County Conservation District (ACCD). Application types consist of Chapter 102 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, E&S plan reviews for sites not needing an NPDES permit, Erosion and Sediment Control General Permits (ESCGPs) for projects associated with oil and gas, and applications for earth disturbance associated with Chapter 105 General Permits issued by ACCD. Features were digitized using paper plans and/or digital plans, where available, and are represented as permit boundaries and limits of disturbance for permits and non-permits, respectively.
