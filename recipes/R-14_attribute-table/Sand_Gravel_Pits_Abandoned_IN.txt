  Description:
    Abstract:
      SAND_GRAVEL_PITS_ABANDONED_IN is a point shapefile that shows the locations of
      abandoned sand and gravel pits in Indiana. It is derived from an unpublished
      memorandum report of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS): Hasenmueller,
      W. A., 2001, Preliminary database of abandoned sand and gravel pits, Coal and
      Industrial Minerals Section Memorandum Report 98, Indiana Geological Survey,
      Bloomington, 3 p., and a CD-ROM.

      NOTE: This shapefile includes 2,275 of 2,515 sand and gravel pit locations from
      the IGS Abandoned Sand and Gravel Pit Database (titled "PrelimSdGvDB.mdb") that
      are located in Indiana and for which the documented location is to the nearest
      quarter quarter section. The 240 pit locations that were excluded did not have adequate
      quarter quarter section information that could be processed by Geographix software.

      The following discussion is derived from Memorandum Report 98:
      "The Microsoft Access 2000 database PrelimSdGvDB.mdb on the enclosed CD contains
      information about abandoned sand and gravel pits in Indiana. The data contained
      in this database represents a preliminary stage in a comprehensive compilation
      of abandoned sand and gravel pit data stored in the files of the Mineral Resources
      Section of the Indiana Geological Survey (IGS). The data were taken from a single
      Mineral Resources Section file titled "DATA TABULATION CARDS: Sand and Gravel
      Pits" which documents abandoned sand and gravel pits examined by IGS geologists
      in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although these data have been assembled into a
      simple flat-file database they should not be regarded as a final compilation of
      the above mentioned file nor should they be regarded as a compilation of all
      abandoned sand and gravel pit information filed in IGS Mineral Resources Section
      files. The Mineral Resources Section is providing this preliminary database in
      response to a request from the Energy Resources Section of the IGS."
    Purpose:
      SAND_GRAVEL_PITS_ABANDONED_IN was created to provide a preliminary digital
      shapefile of abandoned sand and gravel pits in Indiana, suitable for use in
      a GIS.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The sand and gravel pit sites included in this shapefile were identified by IGS field
      geologists or taken from literature sources judged to be reliable by IGS geologists.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Duplicate features may exist in this data set. Sand and gravel pits which were abandoned and
    reopened under a new name may be represented more than once in the data set.
  Completeness_Report:
    This shapefile includes 2,275 of 2,515 sand and gravel pit locations from the IGS Abandoned Sand and Gravel
    Pit Database (titled "PrelimSdGvDB.mdb") that are located in Indiana and for which the documented
    location is to the nearest quarter quarter section. The 240 pit locations that were excluded did not have adequate
    quarter quarter section information that could be processed by Geographix software.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Most of the quarry location coordinates were obtained using Geographix Software and a land grid developed
        by White Star, Inc. (Denver, CO). The locations will be no more precise than the third quarter section,
        or the number of quarter sections in the field named "Qtr".
    Vertical_Positional_Accuracy:
      Vertical_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Stratigraphic measurements are in feet. Measurements are reported to the nearest 0.1 foot. The precision
        of the original data varies from measurement to the nearest 0.1 foot to estimate to the nearest 10 feet.

      Process_Description:
        Information about abandoned sand and gravel pits in Indiana was obtained by IGS geologists from literature
        sources, public records, and visits to sand and gravel pit sites. These data were compiled into
        a file named "Database of Abandoned Sand and Gravel Pits.txt." The Database of Abandoned Sand and Gravel Pits in Indiana was
        converted to a Microsoft Access database (referred to as the "Preliminary Abandoned Sand and Gravel Pits Database").

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The field Qtr from the SdGvDb table was parsed into two new fields, qtr1 and qtr2.
        A new field, qtr3, was added to more precisely describe some of the locations, such
        as "C NW." A text file was then created with locations using the Congressional Land
        Survey System (section, township, and range); this text file was processed with
        GES97 software, GeoGraphix, Inc., using a land grid created by White Star Corp. to
        obtain coordinate locations in UTM Zone 16 NAD27. This data was imported back into
        PrelimSdGvDB.mdb and joined with the SdGvDb table to create the table SG3. Two queries
        were created to count the number of locations from the original file and the number
        of locations that now had coordinate values. A new table, nocoords, was created from
        the results of these queries. A new Access database, S_G.mdb, was created and the tables
        SG3 and nocoords were imported into this database.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        A Microsoft Access table named "SG3" within the database named "S_G.MDB" was exported as
        a DBase IV file named "SG3.DBF." SG3.DBF was then added as a table to an ESRI ArcView 3.3
        View. The Add Event Theme function was used to add the data to the view, and the
        Convert to Shapefile function was used to save the data as a shapefile named "SG3_NAD27.SHP."

        The shapefile was edited in ESRI ArcView 3.3 to eliminate 240 records for which no UTM values were
        available. The fields named "Utmx27" and "Utmy27" were then deleted. SG3_NAD27.SHP was then re-projected
        to UTM Zone 16 NAD83, using the Define Projection Wizard and the Project Wizard of ESRI ArcToolbox 8.3,
        and the resulting shapefile was named "SAND_GRAVEL_PITS_ABANDONED_IN.SHP."
