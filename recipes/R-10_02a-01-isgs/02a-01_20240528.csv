Habitat maps are provided for four study sites which the ISGS has monitored monthly since 2018 using drones.
 
The initial habitat boundaries are from the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory (INAI), provided in August 2018 by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Illinois Nature Preserves Commission, Illinois Endangered Species Protection Board, and the Natural Heritage Database. The INAI habitat surveys were conducted in 1976 for Sites 1-3; surveys for Site 4 were conducted between 2008-2011. The eastern bounds of the habitat maps, defined as the contact between vegetated habitat and Lake Michigan beach sediment, were digitized from historical aerial images (1939-2017) and modern drone images (2018-2020). The modern images were collected using an unoccupied aerial system (UAS) flown at Illinois Beach State Park under contract for the Illinois Department of Natural Resources Coastal Management Program. The historical aerial images were sourced from the Lake County, Illinois, Planning, Building, and Development Department.

Elevation,Illinois Height Modernization (ILHMP): LiDAR Data,https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/data/elevation/illinois-height-modernization-ilhmp,"***New****  Download LiDAR Data thru our new Web Application Viewer.  The Viewer allows users to zoom into an area of interest and then simply select LAS tiles to download.  ***** 
Historically, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data for Illinois have been mainly based on 5- to 10-foot contour data. Large-scale, digital topographic maps are most common; many data resources contain elevation information acquired in the 1920s and 1930s. DEM data collections are now being developed based on data with a contour resolution of 2 feet to 6 inches. A comparison between older data and newer high-resolution data shows remarkable improvement in recorded detail.
ILHMP has established data sharing agreements to archive and distribute elevation data for select Illinois counties. Data have been acquired using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology, in compliance with different contract specifications. Data are offered as originally deliver LAS tile or as the derivative product of DEM/DTM or DSM.

Geology,Illinois Waterflood Units 1946-2002,https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/data/geology/illinois-waterflood-units-1946-2002,"The Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) has collected data regarding injected and produced fluids of oil payzones for over 2000 waterflood projects in Illinois. These data are not collected by any other organization and are available only at the ISGS. These data were compiled to create a comprehensive data layer that delineates boundaries of all known waterflood projects currently operating and that have operated in the past in Illinois. Outlines of individual waterflood projects were compiled from historic hand-drawn maps (1:31680) by ISGS geologists or maps (scales vary) submitted by operators. These maps were scanned and georeferenced. Waterflood projects were then digitized. Information about each waterflood project is contained in a waterflood database completed in conjunction with this data layer. Some information from the waterflood database is related as attributes. As waterflood boundaries may change over time, only a portion of a waterflood throughout its history may be digitally represented. This data layer was created as part of a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Preferred Upstream Maintenance Pressure (PUMP) II initiative (DEFC26-02NT15132).
The data layer delineates boundaries of all known waterflood projects in Illinois in a digitial format. Waterflood information can then be used to distinguish areas that have been waterflooded from those that may not have been waterflooded. Areas not waterflooded or under-flooded can then be identified as underdeveloped areas (UDA's) which may have a high potential for economically feasible secondary oil recovery. Also, historic data is commonly used as analogs to evaluate potential of new floods.

The spatial reference is geographic coordinates, decimal degrees, NAD83. The data are exported to a shapefile weekly from the Wells and Borings (source) database for Internet distribution. The source database is updated daily. Thus, there may be recent updates (last 7 days) in the source database that are not reflected in this shapefile. The data are primarily oil, gas and water wells, but also include other designations such as engineering boring, stratigraphic test hole, injection well, etc. The collection contains data for over 580,000 wells and borings, some dating back to 1801 (assumed.) Most locations have not been field verified. The nominal scale is 1:62,500, however locations have been determined in several different ways at different scales. Most commonly, the location is derived by converting a legal (i.e. Public Land Survey Survey - PLSS) description to a point location. The stated accuracy is +/- 100 feet, however some points may be inaccurate by as much as one mile due to irregularities in the Illinois PLSS and associated descriptions. For legal descriptions that indicate only a PLSS section or quarter-section, the point is assumed to be in the center of the respective section or quarter-section. Additional detailed information about these wells and borings is available free of charge online through the Illinois State Geological Survey in the ILOIL (oil and gas) and ILWATER (water and related wells) interactive map services.  Additional information may include owner, permit details, PLSS location, total depth, surface elevation, geologic formation and material description, driller's log, and down-hole logs.",https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/sites/clearinghouse.isgs/files/clearinghouse/data/metadata/ISGS/IL_WELLS_Borings_Location_Pt.shp.html,,,,,,https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/sites/clearinghouse.isgs/files/Clearinghouse/data/ISGS/Geology/zips/IL_WELLS_Borings_Location_Pt.zip,02a-01_geology-location-points-isgs-wells-and-borings-database,Location Points from the ISGS Wells and Borings Database [Illinois],,Geology,Datasets,02a-01,Public,HTML,2024-05-28,eng,02a-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,Illinois Geospatial Data Clearinghouse,https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/data/geology/location-points-isgs-wells-and-borings-database,File,"-91.51,36.97,-87.02,42.51"

Center pivot irrigation imprints identifiable circular patterns on the landscape which can be visible in aerial images. The USDA collects aerial images during the crop growing season through the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) and makes them available through the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway. Images collected by the USDA during the 2012 and 2014 growing seasons were used to develop this coverage of center pivot irrigation areas. This was done by digitizing the area under each irrigation system using ArcGIS to plot the maps spatially, and creating a polygon for each individual system. The NAIP images were examined for irrigation patterns, and field boundaries were traced to create an ArcGIS map layer. In reviewing the USDA 2014 data, a QA/QC check indicated a few polygons were omitted from the original 2012 map. This revision includes the 2012 omitted systems and additional pivots identified from USDA images collected during the 2014 growing season. Using aerial photography to identify irrigation systems is limited by the resolution and timing of the photography, and in some cases a system may not have been discernable and may have been missed.
A total of 5,829 center pivot irrigation systems were identified in Illinois during the summer of 2012, representing approximately 553,000 acres of farmland. An additional 826 pivots were in use during the 2014 growing season, bringing the statewide total to 6,656 center pivot systems irrigating approximately 625,000 acres of farmland in 2014. This GIS layer does not include all forms of irrigation employed in Illinois. Alternative irrigation methods include subsurface, lateral-move, solidset, and traveling gun. These types of irrigation systems may cover a significant number of irrigated acres and are not reflected in this coverage.

The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files. The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year update of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
Purpose
NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment.

Imagery,2011 Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) Orthophotography,https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/data/imagery/2011-illinois-department-transportation-idot-orthophotography,"The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) coordinated the funding and acquisition of the 2011 digital orhtophotography for 95 counties in Illinois. The metropolitan Chicago area including Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties were not acquired as part of this IDOT project. The native projection for the 2011 IDOT orthophotography is transverse Mercator, Illinois State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), West and East zones, NAD 1983 datum.
For the purposes of data delivery and distribution, the orthophotography is organized into data tiles, each covering a geographic area of 10,000 ft. x 10,000 ft. The ground spatial resolution of each orthophoto tile is 1 ft. x 1 ft. per pixel for 93 of the 95 Illinois counties. Because of a county cost-sharing option made available as part of the 2011 IDOT orthophotography project, higher resolution orthophotography with a ground spatial resolution 0.5 ft. x 0.5 ft. was processed and is available for Sangamon and Tazewell Counties, as well as a portion of Woodford County. Each data tile was created utilizing multiple aerial images. The metadata for each tile will show the date the imagery was captured.
Images were captured between March 16th and May 30th, 2011, using a Z/I Imaging Digital Mapping Camera (DMC). The DMC system collects imagery in four spectral bands, and therefore users can select between either a natural color rendition (RGB = 1,2,3) or near-infrared rendition (RGB = 4,1,2) for a particular application:
Band 1 = Red (598-675 nm)
Band 2 = Green (500-650 nm)
Band 3 = Blue (400-580 nm)

The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files. The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year update of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
Purpose
NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment. The NAIP is also used for disaster response.",,,,https://data.isgs.illinois.edu/arcgis/rest/services/Imagery/NAIP_2019/ImageServer,,,,02a-01_imagery-2019-illinois-naip-digital-orthophoto-quadrangle-data,NAIP Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle Data [Illinois] {2019},2019,Imagery,Imagery,02a-01,Public,HTML,2024-05-28,eng,02a-01,ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,Illinois Geospatial Data Clearinghouse,https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/data/imagery/2019-illinois-naip-digital-orthophoto-quadrangle-data,File,"-91.51,36.97,-87.02,42.51"

The main goal of Gap Analysis is to prevent additional species from being listed as threatened or endangered. The program uses a ""bottom-up"" approach that allows for creativity and collaboration at the state and local governmental levels where most land management decisions are made. The intent of Gap Analysis is to provide focus and direction for proactive, rather than reactive land management activities. It is anticipated that Gap Analysis is a step toward comprehensive land management planning that transcends political boundaries.
The Illinois Gap Analysis Project(link is external) (IL-GAP) is a statewide land cover classification. The project was initiated in 1996 at the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS). The INHS has been conducting research on Illinois' biological resources since 1858, which makes it the ideal institution for conducting the state's Gap Analysis.

The surveyors moved across the state laying out a rectangular grid system, known as the Public Land Survey System (PLS or PLSS). They were required to keep field notebooks where they noted details about their survey (such as which kind of tree was 'blazed' or marked at the section corners), as well as notes about the quality of the landscape, mines, salt licks, watercourses, springs, mill seats and other 'remarkable and permanent things'. Once a township was finished, the surveyors were to make a map of the area. These surveys represent one of the earliest detailed maps for Illinois. They predate our county land ownership maps and atlases. These plat maps and field notebooks contain a wealth of information about what the landscape was like before the flood of settlers came into the state. Most of the over 1,700 townships in Illinois have at least one version of the original surveyor's map. Additional redrafted versions are also available for all townships. The redrafted versions were created in the 1850's at the regional GLO office in St. Louis, Missouri. Cartographers used the original maps in consultation with the field notebooks to create a more complete map of the township.
